<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be seen by the following
Circular and Correspondence how the Discourses of the Bishop of
Peterborough and Mr. Bradlaugh&rsquo;s Replies thereto were
brought about.&nbsp; The Dean&rsquo;s Circular speaks of four
Discourses to be delivered by the Bishop, but in fact only the
three here reported were given.&nbsp; This volume, therefore,
contains the whole of both sides of the question, so far as the
discussion has hitherto proceeded in Norwich.&nbsp; The speeches
were all taken down by a competent shorthand reporter, specially
engaged for the <i>National Reformer</i>.</p>
<p>The reader will clearly see by the Correspondence that the
Christians refused the proposal of the Secularists that the two
parties should co-operate in publishing together and circulating
as widely as possible the Discourses and Replies.&nbsp; Mr.
Bradlaugh has therefore taken upon himself the responsibility of
their joint publication.&nbsp; The extraordinary reasons given by
the Dean (in the last paragraph of his letter of Feb. 15th) for
refusing the perfectly fair offer of Mr. Cooper, will not pass
unnoted.&nbsp; His claim to certainty <i>may</i> differ from the
claim to infallibility made on behalf of the Pope and the Romish
Church, and the principle on which he condemns the dissemination
of Sceptical works as treason to human welfare, <i>may</i> differ
from that which in Rome has led to the establishment of the
<i>Index Expurgatorius</i>; but we confess that in neither case
can we see the difference, and we challenge the Dean to show that
there really is any.</p>
<p>We are confident that Freethinkers generally will appreciate
the disinterested zeal of Mr. R. A. Cooper in making all
arrangements necessary to ensure that the Bishop&rsquo;s
Discourses should be fitly answered on the spot and without
delay.</p>

iv</span>CIRCULAR OF THE DEAN OF NORWICH.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am about to ask your
kind help in an enterprise undertaken for the religious welfare
of our fellow-citizens, to the success of which your co-operation
may very materially contribute.&nbsp; It has been thought that in
large cities, where sceptical views are often so much
disseminated, and spread so widely among all classes, good might
be done, under God&rsquo;s blessing, by an annual series of
discourses from some competent preacher, directed against modern
forms of infidelity, and afterwards published and circulated at
so low a price as should put them within the reach of all.&nbsp;
It is chiefly with the view of holding such discourses there,
that the Dean and Chapter have recently caused the Nave of the
Cathedral Church to be lighted and furnished with chairs, <i>all
of which</i> (except, a very few reserved for persons engaged in
the service, or connected with the Cathedral) <i>will be
perfectly free</i>.&nbsp; With the view of giving the preachers a
larger discretion as to time, and of making the whole service
shorter, it is proposed to use before the sermon the Litany only
with one or two hymns.&nbsp; I may add that the whole scheme has
the thorough sanction and concurrence of the Lord Bishop of the
Diocese, who has been consulted on every part of it.</p>
<p><i>The Lord Bishop of Peterborough has kindly undertaken to
give the first series of discourses on Tuesday</i>, <i>the</i>
21<i>st</i>, <i>Tuesday</i>, <i>the</i> 28<i>th</i>,
<i>Wednesday</i>, <i>the</i> 29<i>th</i>, <i>and Thursday</i>,
<i>the</i> 30<i>th</i> <i>of March</i>, <i>the service each
evening commencing at</i> 8 <i>p.m.</i></p>
<p>If you approve of our scheme (and pray observe that <i>the
discourses</i>, <i>having for their object the vindication and
establishment of the Christian faith</i>, <i>will in all
probability hardly notice the points on which Christians of
various Communions differ</i>), will you kindly help us, first,
by making known among your workpeople or parishioners the days
and hours of the services, with the name of the preacher, and
encouraging them to attend; secondly, by circulating among them
the discourses, when published, of which I shall be greatly
pleased to send you as large a number as you think you can
dispose of?&nbsp; On this last point I shall be obliged by a
communication from you.</p>
<p>The subject of the first series of discourses will be
&ldquo;Free Thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I have the honour to be, Sir, your
obedient servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. <span class="smcap">Meyrick
Goulburn</span>, D.D.<br />
Dean of Norwich.</p>
<p>The Deanery, Norwich, February 7th, 1871.</p>
<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Norwich, Feb. 13th, 1871.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;I received with
extreme pleasure your circular letter of 7th inst., relating to,
and defining the objects of the Discourses intended to be
delivered next month in the Cathedral, by the Bishop of
Peterborough, and I am induced to reply to it by the conviction
that great good may result from &ldquo;the scheme,&rdquo; if you
can be induced to modify it in some particulars.</p>
<p>The circular states that the Discourses are to be
&ldquo;directed against modern forms of infidelity,&rdquo; and
have for their object the &ldquo;vindication and establishment of
the Christian faith,&rdquo; but I assume your ultimate object is
the vindication and establishment of truth&mdash;no matter what
the truth may be.&nbsp; If my assumption be correct, I heartily
sympathise with your object, and as a Sceptic or Infidel, will
co-operate with my Christian brethren if permitted.</p>
<p>May I call your attention to a practical difficulty in the way
of the scheme, which I fear you have not sufficiently
considered?&nbsp; In the present state of opinion, or rather in
the absence of real opinion, on these subjects, Sceptics or
Infidels cannot always insure the attention of Christian hearers,
or of persons indifferent to the subject of their discourses, but
these and not the confirmed Infidels, are the persons the zealous
Sceptic most desires to reach.&nbsp; I imagine your difficulty is
the same.&nbsp; You want to get at the mighty mass who know and
care nothing about these questions, and also at the Infidel whose
opinions you deem so mischievous.&nbsp; The fact is, the great
mass and the Infidel are not likely to attend unless their
attention be in some manner especially drawn to the Discourses,
but you will probably have a large congregation of believing
Christians, whose faith may be confirmed, but yet who do not hold
opinions you wish to change.</p>
<p>I beg to suggest a mode by which I think the difficulty may be
removed, and an interest created that will be useful to the cause
of truth&mdash;to Christian truth, if Christianity be
true&mdash;but to truth, whether Christianity be true or
false.</p>
<p>I intend to invite to Norwich some person who shall be well
known as a representative exponent &ldquo;of modern forms of
Infidelity,&rdquo; and request him to deliver a course of
lectures at about the same time, and on the same subject as that
chosen by the Bishop of Peterborough, and if you think it would
be useful to give the public the opportunity of reading as well
as hearing the discourses, both expositions of the subject might
be published together, and more extensively circulated and read,
in consequence of the greater interest that would be thus
created.</p>
<p>I have always scrupulously abstained from doing anything to
influence the politics or religion of persons in my employment,
but in <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>accordance with your wish, I will take care to inform
them all of the Discourses, and also acquaint them with the high
reputation which the Bishop of Peterborough enjoys as a
preacher.</p>
<p>I should be willing to subscribe for 200 copies of the joint
publication, which will enable me to present one to every man and
boy in my employment, who is willing to accept it, and the
remainder I shall be happy to distribute according to the
suggestion of the circular.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, Rev. Sir, your obedient
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Robert A.
Cooper</span>.</p>
<p>The Very Rev. E. M. Goulburn,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dean of Norwich.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">The Deanery, Norwich, Feb. 15th,
1871.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg to acknowledge
your letter of the 13th inst., and to thank you for the readiness
you express to circulate among persons in your employment, the
announcement of the Bishop of Peterborough&rsquo;s Sermons.</p>
<p>I regret that I cannot meet this kindness on your part by
assisting in any way in the circulation of tracts by a
representative exponent &ldquo;of modern forms of
infidelity,&rdquo; and I will explain in few words the reason why
I must decline the joint publication suggested by your
letter.</p>
<p>Professing yourself (as you do) a &ldquo;Sceptic,&rdquo; by
which I conceive is meant (according to the derivation of the
word) one who has doubts as to religious truth, and, therefore,
is engaged in an inquiry, having for its object the resolution of
those doubts and the arrival at a conclusion; it is (under your
view of the subject) perfectly consistent and reasonable that you
should do all in your power to get both sides of the religious
question ably and fairly expounded, in order to give yourself and
others an opportunity of forming a right conclusion.</p>
<p>But my conclusion on the momentous question has long since
been made up.&nbsp; I am as firmly convinced that Christianity is
God&rsquo;s own message to the world, the truth and the only
truth, the way, and the only way, of happiness and peace, as that
the sun is now shining in the heavens.&nbsp; I cannot, therefore,
help regarding any attempt to throw doubt or discredit on
Christianity as a treason against the highest well-being of my
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; And you will see, therefore, that (under
my view) I could not properly join in disseminating publications,
which, at the very least, will insinuate a doubt as to that
revealed religion which I hold to be the only means of raising
and saving our fallen race.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain, Sir, your obedient
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. <span class="smcap">Meyrick
Goulburn</span>.</p>
<p>Mr. Robert A. Cooper.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Norwich, Feb. 25th, 1871.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;I have to
acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 15th inst. (which came to
hand on the 22nd), and to regret that you can engage in the
circulation of only one side of the important question you
propose to expound.&nbsp; And I regret it for these reasons,
because by so restricting your action, you, while attacking,
prevent the fair expression of that form of thought which you
seek to destroy, and <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>allow those who hold such opinions
to shelter themselves, if need be, under the assumption that your
exposition of the case is not theirs.&nbsp; And, also, because
your expression of the unqualified certainty of your own
conviction of the truth of Christianity (obtained, doubtless,
from a consideration of all sides of the subject), is open to the
objection that you fear to trust the impartial examination of the
evidence of that truth to the minds of others, and implies a
latent, though unconscious, doubt of the certainty of the proof
of that truth of which you speak so positively.</p>
<p>I cannot accept your description of my position as a
&ldquo;Sceptic or Infidel,&rdquo; but let that pass.</p>
<p>I am still disposed to subscribe for 200 copies of the
Bishop&rsquo;s sermons, and if you desire me to distribute more,
I have no doubt I can dispose of a considerable number.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, Rev. Sir, your obedient
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Robert A.
Cooper</span>.</p>
<p>The Very Rev. E. M. Goulburn,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dean of Norwich.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">The Deanery, Norwich, Feb. 25th,
1871.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In reply to your letter
of to-day, in which you say, &ldquo;I cannot accept your
description of my position as a &lsquo;Sceptic or
Infidel,&rsquo;&rdquo; I hasten to assure you that I should never
have presumed to describe your position as such, had I not
imagined I had your own authority for doing so.&nbsp; The words
of your letter of the 13th inst., from which I drew this
inference, are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If my assumption be correct, I heartily
sympathise with your object, and as a Sceptic or Infidel, will
co-operate with my Christian brethren if permitted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am thankful and rejoiced to find that my inference was an
incorrect one; but I trust you will acknowledge that there was
some ground in the wording of the sentence for my making it.</p>
<p>I shall be happy to request your <i>acceptance</i> of 200
copies of the Bishop&rsquo;s Discourses, and am much obliged to
you for your offer of circulating them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours very faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. M. <span
class="smcap">Goulburn</span>.</p>
<p>Mr. Robert A. Cooper.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Norwich, March 1st, 1871.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;I am sorry that in
the sentence you refer to, I did not express my meaning with
sufficient clearness to be understood; though I am unable to see
that it will bear the construction you put upon it.</p>
<p>In the circular letter, you speak of the prevalence, in large
cities, of &ldquo;sceptical views,&rdquo; and also of
&ldquo;modern forms of infidelity,&rdquo; evidently using the
words &ldquo;sceptical&rdquo; and &ldquo;infidelity&rdquo; in
their popular and ordinary, and not in their strict, grammatical
sense.</p>
<p>I say evidently, because the phrases &ldquo;sceptical
views,&rdquo; and &ldquo;modern infidelity&rdquo; appear to be
intended as equivalent, and I therefore assume that you use them
in their popular sense, because if I am to suppose you use the
word &ldquo;sceptical&rdquo; in its strict etymological <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>meaning,
I must also that you do the word &ldquo;infidelity,&rdquo; and I
am reluctant to think that you would, in speaking of the opinions
of people who you must know are as sincere and honest as
yourself, deliberately and intentionally do that.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;sceptical views&rdquo; and &ldquo;modern forms of
infidelity,&rdquo; I understood you to mean both doubt and
disbelief of the truth of religion in general, and Christianity
in particular, and I therefore accepted in substance your own
phraseology in the popular sense in which you appeared to use it,
and I speak of myself as a &ldquo;Sceptic or Infidel,&rdquo;
meaning thereby that I am not merely a doubter, but a
disbeliever&mdash;a disbeliever not of &ldquo;religious
truth,&rdquo; but the truth of any religion.&nbsp; It is so
common for religious people to speak of disbelievers in general
as &ldquo;sceptics&rdquo; or &ldquo;infidels,&rdquo; without
regard to the derivation or strict meaning of the words, that I
think it would have been pedantic to appear to have understood
them in any other than their common, and I deem not very correct,
meaning.</p>
<p>You were, therefore, perfectly entitled to say you had my
authority for describing me as a &ldquo;Sceptic:&rdquo; what I
demurred to was your description of my position as a
&ldquo;Sceptic&rdquo; as I had adopted the term in the sense in
which you seem to use it in your circular, but not in the sense
of your letter.&nbsp; I think the misconception would have been
avoided had you used the whole instead of the half of my
expression&mdash;viz., &ldquo;Sceptic or Infidel,&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;Sceptic&rdquo; only; as your description, if correct,
of the position of a &ldquo;Sceptic&rdquo; will clearly not apply
to a &ldquo;Sceptic or Infidel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here I will endeavour to state &ldquo;my conclusion on the
momentous question.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am quite convinced that the
history of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the New Testament, is a
fable entirely unworthy of credence, and that the Christian and
all other systems of religion are but mischievous delusions, but
the nature of the evidence by which I arrive at these
conclusions, is so different from that which convinces me that
the sun is shining in the heavens (space?) that I could not use
that form of words as correctly expressing the strength of my
convictions.</p>
<p>I regret it is necessary to occupy your time with so long an
explanation.&nbsp; Although I could not agree with what you said,
I did not wish to trouble you further on that point, and thought
it would be sufficient to indicate a dissent without going into
detail.&nbsp; Brevity was a failure, and I apologise.</p>
<p>I am, Rev. Sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">[<i>First Discourse of the Bishop
of Peterborough</i>, <i>delivered in Norwich Cathedral</i>,
<i>March</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1871.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Tuesday evening, March 28th, the
Right Rev. Dr. Magee, Lord Bishop of Peterborough, preached the
first of a series of Sermons on Christianity and Freethought,
before a large congregation in the nave of the Cathedral.&nbsp;
According to the Dean&rsquo;s previous arrangements, the nave was
occupied by men, and the south aisle by ladies.&nbsp; The nave
was brilliantly lighted, and the Lord Bishop of Norwich and the
full chapter took part in the service.</p>
<p>After prayers were intoned and a hymn sung, the Right Rev.
Prelate selected his text from the Gospel according to St. John,
viii. 33: &ldquo;How sayest thou, Ye shall be made
free?&rdquo;&nbsp; His Lordship said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The scene that is described in this chapter makes,
I think, a fitting introduction to the series of sermons of which
I am here to-night to preach the first.&nbsp; These sermons are
meant to be pleadings for Christ.&nbsp; Their object is to win
back to him those who may have left him, to cause those who have
not left him to cling to him more strongly; to win back disciples
to Christ, and to confirm disciples in their discipleship.&nbsp;
That is what I and those who are to follow me here have in
view.&nbsp; For this reason I ask you to-night to study this
story in the life of Christ, because it is one in which we see
how Christ himself, long ago, first won and then lost
disciples.</p>
<p>The scene commences with a large accession of disciples to
Christ.&nbsp; We read, that as he spoke these words many believed
on him, and the scene ends with many of those very believers
taking up stones to cast at him.&nbsp; First they believed on
him, shortly after they seek to take his life; and after this is
over, we read how his own disciples came to him again, and <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>said to him,
&ldquo;Master, tell us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, brethren, we Christians
believe that in this scene was a prophecy of the whole history of
Christ&rsquo;s life upon earth in his Church; the story of those
who come and those who go, of those who believe in him at first,
and of those who cease to believe in him, and also the inner
history of those that never forsake him.&nbsp; We believe that
when the noisy strife of things has passed away, and the
execrations of those that hated him have ceased to ring upon the
ear, there still will be heard the voice of the Church, saying
&ldquo;Master, tell us,&rdquo; that which others will not, or
cannot listen to; &ldquo;Master, to whom shall we go? thou hast
the words of eternal life.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is not on those
who thus stay with Christ that I ask you to fix your
attention.&nbsp; I ask you to-night to contemplate with me, not
those who remain with him, but those who leave him.&nbsp; I ask
you to understand a little of that mental history that is here
shown us, telling us how they passed from belief to doubt, and
from doubt to rejection of Christ.</p>
<p>It will be profitable to us, I think, both to those who
believe and to those who unhappily disbelieve in Christ, that we
should study a little this early instance of Freethought and
disbelief.&nbsp; It will be good for those who do not believe in
Christ to look at this scene, because it will show this fact,
that there were those who disbelieved in Christ.&nbsp; It will
show this fact, that this is not a religion whose origin is lost
in the dim distance of time; it is not a legendary faith of which
no one can say when it began or who first taught it, as it arose
in historical times; a faith continuing from the very first, not
without question or dispute, but in spite of the question and
notwithstanding the dispute.&nbsp; It will show that Freethought
is as old as Christianity itself, and when we read how long it is
since men had the same doubts and difficulties, it will occur to
us that after all there must be a wonderful power in this faith
that struggles into acceptance in spite of those doubts and
difficulties, and that there must be some marvellous vitality in
the faith that has survived 1800 years, something that is worth
inquiring into.&nbsp; This bush that is burning and never burned,
is worth turning aside to look at.&nbsp; It will be good for us
to look at those early unbelievers, because it strengthens our
faith to be reminded that unbelief is no new thing, and that
Christianity has survived more than 1800 years.</p>
<p>It is good for another reason; it teaches us to try to
understand the feelings of those who don&rsquo;t believe; it
teaches us to try to put ourselves in their place, to try to <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>understand how
it is they don&rsquo;t agree with us; to make all allowances for
the honesty of their disbelief, to try to enter fairly into their
motives and feelings.&nbsp; If we don&rsquo;t do this, we are in
danger of being hard, and bitter, and unjust in contending for
him, but not in his spirit; forgetting that there is not one of
those who disbelieve in him, for whom he has not died, forgetting
that an unbeliever is not an enemy to be driven back from the
fortress, but an exile to be won back by earnest reasoning to his
Father in Heaven.&nbsp; Let us learn, above all, that in all our
arguments for Christianity we should be filled with the spirit of
him for whom we plead, and that we should manifest the truth in
love.</p>
<p>We ask you then to contemplate this scene, in which we find
Christ winning and losing disciples, and learn something.&nbsp;
And the first thing we have to remark is this, how very little
those that come and go seem to have been influenced by what we
call the evidences of Christianity.&nbsp; They were doubtless
drawn to Christ by the fame of his miracles, it does not seem to
have been his miracles that converted them.&nbsp; It was as
&ldquo;he said those words many believed on him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he said something else, and they left him.&nbsp; It was not
that they doubted of his ability to work miracles, but because
something he said offended them.&nbsp; They came to him not
altogether in consequence of his miracles, and they left him in
spite of his miracles.&nbsp; It teaches us that the religion of
Christ was not received unquestioningly, even in the case of his
miracles, for in spite of his miracles they ventured to question
his doctrine; so that those who say Christianity was received in
an ignorant age are contradicted by the story of Christianity
itself, for many of those who saw his miracles rejected him.</p>
<p>There is another reason for noting this, in order to observe
the power of prejudice and passion in influencing men&rsquo;s
belief or disbelief.&nbsp; There are few men who believe strictly
in accordance with their reflecting faculties.&nbsp; The desires,
prejudices, and passions of men largely share in the making of
their beliefs; and if this be true of beliefs, it is equally true
of men&rsquo;s unbelief.&nbsp; If there be those here who do not
believe in Christ, I ask them: Are you quite sure that your
unbelief is the result of calm, and thoughtful, and careful study
of what Christianity has to say for itself?&nbsp; Are you sure
you have not hastily taken up some objections against
Christianity without waiting for the answer?&nbsp; Are you quite
sure that you have not misunderstood some words of <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Christ&mdash;some words that, having offended you, you
have passed away without waiting for the reason?&nbsp; Are you
sure that there is no unreason in your unbelief, you that say
there is so little reason in our belief?&nbsp; It is because I am
deeply convinced of this that I am here.&nbsp; It is because I
believe that misconception, prejudice, and hasty adoption of
other men&rsquo;s opinions upon slender grounds, make a large
part of ignorant belief, often a large part of ignorant
unbelief.&nbsp; It is because these misunderstandings may be
removed, that I am here to speak of the subjects I have
announced.&nbsp; It is because I believe it is useless to argue
against prejudices, that I shall endeavour to remove those
prejudices, and mistaken feelings and opinions, that make men
unwilling to listen to arguments for Christianity.&nbsp; Those
who follow me will bring many arguments for Christianity, and I
am here to-night to prepare the way for them.</p>
<p>I ask you, then, to turn again to this story, and to see why
it was that those new disciples left Christ.&nbsp; It was for
this reason, that they were offended because he appeared to deny
them the possession of liberty.&nbsp; When they became his
disciples he said, &ldquo;Ye shall know the truth, and the truth
shall make you free.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they answered him,
&ldquo;We be Abraham&rsquo;s seed, and were never in bondage to
any man; how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
had offered them liberty, and this implied that they were not
free, and this they regarded as the gravest of affronts.&nbsp;
We, the children of Abraham, the aristocracy of humanity, those
whom the Lord delivered out of Egypt, whose slaves are we that
you venture to offer us freedom?&nbsp; The offer is an absurdity
and an affront, and you are denying us freedom in the very words;
and so left him, for they deemed it an insult to their birthright
of freedom.&nbsp; We, who understand the story, can see how much
these men were mistaken.&nbsp; Our Lord was offering them moral
freedom, and they supposed that he was offering them political
freedom.</p>
<p>There was a misunderstanding as to the nature of liberty; he
offered them a liberty for which they were not desirous.&nbsp; It
was a dispute about liberty between Christ and those first
Freethinkers.&nbsp; Now, may there not be some misunderstanding
still?&nbsp; That is the subject of my sermon to-night.&nbsp; It
is Christianity and Freethought.&nbsp; What do you understand by
Freethought?&nbsp; Something opposed to Christianity; and by a
Freethinker, one who rejects all or a part of Christianity.&nbsp;
Why do such men give themselves that name?&nbsp; Because it <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>expresses their
conviction that Christianity is opposed to freedom of thought,
that it puts a restraint on the human intellect.&nbsp; They say
that Christianity shackles the human mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I boast
of my freedom,&rdquo; says the Freethinker; &ldquo;you require me
to submit the freedom of my intellect to the authority of a
book.&nbsp; My mind resents such an attempt to fetter it, I
submit to no authority.&nbsp; You priests and bigots that come to
me with your authority, and threaten me with penalties for daring
to think thus and thus, you are convicting yourselves of
falsehood before you utter another word, for you are opposed to
freedom.&nbsp; I cannot listen to your evidences of
Christianity.&nbsp; No proof of miracle will make me give up my
freedom of thought.&rdquo;&nbsp; How often do we hear of the
bigotry of the priest, and the enlightened Freethought of the
age.&nbsp; Mark then, we have the issue raised between
Christianity and Freethought.&nbsp; Let us understand it clearly,
before we go further.&nbsp; It is true that Christianity comes
with a claim of authority.&nbsp; It is true that Christianity
says, Believe this and that, because Christ has said it.&nbsp; He
is seeking men now, as he did, with authority; and it is true
that Christianity does warn men of certain penalties, heavy and
grievous penalties, if they don&rsquo;t believe what Christ
says.&nbsp; Christianity is authoritative teaching, accompanied
with threats of penalties.&nbsp; Now we are told, that is just
the point at which Christianity comes into collision with
Freethought.&nbsp; Freedom of thought will not endure to hear of
authority, and resents the very idea of penalty.</p>
<p>Now we have put before us the issue between Christianity and
Freethought.&nbsp; It is necessary that we should define for
ourselves what is Freethought.&nbsp; The word is on men&rsquo;s
lips, and I am not sure that they understand what they mean by
it.&nbsp; Let us try to understand what is Freethought.&nbsp; It
may mean one of three things.&nbsp; It may mean freedom as
opposed to necessity, it may mean freedom as opposed to
authority, or it may mean freedom as opposed to
responsibility.&nbsp; As regards the first of these, by freedom
as opposed to necessity, we mean that a man is free to think in
one way or another, that it is not absolutely necessary for him
always to think in one way or another; that is to say, his
thought is not the necessary product of physical constitution,
that his thoughts do not grow out of him, as the blade grows out
of the seed or the flower out of the plant; that it is not
mechanical or necessary, but that a man has the power to choose
how he will think.&nbsp; Then as to <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>freedom as opposed to authority, we
mean that a man is not bound to think like other men&mdash;that
is, his thought is not subject to any other man&rsquo;s, and he
has a right to say, &ldquo;That is your opinion and not
mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Freedom of thought as opposed to
responsibility means that a man is not answerable for his belief,
and that whatever he thinks on any subject, he is never to suffer
for his belief in any way whatever.&nbsp; These three are the
only possible meanings.</p>
<p>Now let us take them in their order.</p>
<p>First, freedom of thought as opposed to necessity.&nbsp; Does
Christianity deny this freedom?&nbsp; On the contrary, it asserts
and vindicates it.&nbsp; Christianity teaches that man is free,
and terribly free, to will his own belief.&nbsp; It teaches this
by the fact that it tells us a man is answerable for his belief,
for a man cannot be answerable for that in which he has no
choice, any more than he has of the colour of his hair.&nbsp; If
he be answerable, it can only be because he has the power of
choosing.&nbsp; It is remarkable that many people who call
themselves Freethinkers, insist on it that man is not answerable
for his belief any more than for the colour of his hair.&nbsp;
They thus deny the freedom of thought.&nbsp; Freedom and
responsibility always go together; so you see in this view of
Freethought, Christianity, so far from denying it, asserts it
against many Freethinkers; and in this respect the Christian is
the Freethinker, and maintains the doctrine of Freethought.</p>
<p>Second, freedom of thought as opposed to the idea of all
authority.&nbsp; We are told that thought cannot be free if it
submits to any authority, and it is quite true in the
abstract.&nbsp; Attend to this.&nbsp; It is true that the
abstract idea of freedom is opposed to the abstract idea of
authority, in thought or religion.&nbsp; But it is equally true,
that these are opposed in everything else.&nbsp; It is just as
true in politics, in which the idea of freedom is opposed to the
idea of authority.&nbsp; Where there is absolute freedom, there
cannot be authority.&nbsp; Where there is absolute authority, we
cannot understand logically how there can be any freedom.&nbsp;
Starting from the maxim, &ldquo;Man is free,&rdquo; we arrive
logically at the conclusion that there can be no authority for
that man.&nbsp; Starting from the axiom, &ldquo;Authority is
supreme,&rdquo; is to arrive at the logical conclusion that there
is no room for liberty.&nbsp; The two ideas are logically
opposed, the one to the other.&nbsp; But are they so in
practice?&nbsp; Is it a fact that freedom is found inconsistent
with authority?&nbsp; Is it not true that men reconcile them
every day?&nbsp; Is it not true that thought is free, and yet
thought submits itself to <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>authority?&nbsp; Many cherished
opinions are received on authority, not because we have proved
them ourselves.&nbsp; We take the opinion of a lawyer on law, and
of a doctor on medicine, as authority.&nbsp; Morality itself is
largely received upon authority.&nbsp; We are always submitting
ourselves to authority.&nbsp; Logically, freedom and authority
are separate, but there never was a society in which the two did
not come together.&nbsp; They are like the chemical elements,
which have a strong affinity for each other, and are never apart,
except when separated in the laboratory of the chemist, but the
moment they are liberated they are together again.&nbsp; It is
just the same with Freethought and authority.&nbsp; Men are
always submitting themselves to authority, and if they did not
they would never learn or know anything.&nbsp; When we speak of
the authority of a revelation from God, we mean that we bring to
Freethought, to judge of, the reasons for believing that the
teacher knows more about the things he teaches than others.&nbsp;
That is a very large part of what is called &ldquo;the evidence
from miracles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men speak as if the miracles were the
evidences of the morals of the Gospel.&nbsp; That is not what we
say.&nbsp; What we say is this, Our Lord coming down from heaven
(as we believe) to tell us of another and supernatural world of
which he knew and we did not, gave evidence of that knowledge by
bringing down the supernatural.</p>
<p>Let us suppose we were walking through one of the church-yards
of this city with another person, and the discourse fell upon the
resurrection.&nbsp; If you said it was impossible for any
authority to prove it, and the person said, I know there can be a
resurrection of the dead, and I will give you a proof of it; and
suppose he bade the dead rise, and they sprang alive out of the
earth; do you mean to say that would be no authority from him on
the question of the resurrection of the dead?&nbsp; Would it be a
tyranny over Freethought to be told that the dead can rise?&nbsp;
So you see Freethought is not inconsistent with the authority of
a revelation, for this reason, that the revelation submits its
proof to your Freethought.</p>
<p>I am not saying that I have proved the miracles, I am only
saying that by miracles we are not violating Freethought; but on
the contrary we are maintaining it.&nbsp; I speak as unto wise
men, judge ye what I say.</p>
<p>I now come to the third idea of freedom, that is, freedom as
opposed to responsibility; and this is, I really believe, what
men mean when they speak of Freethought as opposed to
Christianity.&nbsp; They say, &ldquo;You threaten us with
penalties for unbelief, and our whole soul <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>revolts against
that.&nbsp; It would be tyrannical to punish a man for his
opinions.&nbsp; We cannot endure men to do this.&nbsp; Do you
mean to say that God will be less just than man and persecute us
for our opinions?&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us see whether we clearly
understand this question.&nbsp; This objection goes to the
principle that no man should be punished for his opinions.&nbsp;
I will ask you to consider this question.&nbsp; Is it true that
no man under any circumstances should be punished for his
opinions?&nbsp; And again is it true that men do not suffer for
their opinions?&nbsp; It is true that so long as he keeps his
thoughts to himself, he will not be punished for them, for the
simple reason that they are not known; but when he utters them,
he may be punished.&nbsp; Is it not true, that a man who utters a
seditious, a libellous, or indecent thought is punished and
should be punished?&nbsp; And why? because the law of liberty of
the individual comes into collision with the higher law of the
general welfare, and must give way to it.&nbsp; There are other
penalties; society punishes a man more sharply than the
law.&nbsp; There are offences of thought and speech which the law
does not and should not punish, and yet which society visits very
heavily.&nbsp; Let a man entertain evil and unkind thoughts of
his neighbour, and show it by his looks, and we know how society
visits him for his Freethought.&nbsp; Every man knows that if all
the thoughts of his heart were laid bare, before his fellow men,
he might pass a miserable and outcast existence, because society
defends itself against this injurious exercise of
Freethought.</p>
<p>Then pass a step further, and think of the constitution of
nature and of the laws of the world.&nbsp; Does this world of
nature allow of Freethought?&nbsp; Do these natural laws allow a
man to make mistakes with impunity?&nbsp; Let any man think wrong
of the powers of nature, that fire will not burn nor water drown,
and he will soon find himself visited with a sharp and merciless
punishment, for there are no laws so merciless as those of
nature.&nbsp; He that transgresses them ignorantly or wittingly,
is beaten alike with many stripes.&nbsp; The great revolving
machinery of the world will not arrest its revolutions because of
the cry of a human creature that by a very innocent error, even
by his mistaken action of Freethought, is ground to pieces
beneath them.&nbsp; If the man of science warns us of the
consequences of transgressing the laws that he has discovered, we
should be at liberty to think differently from him, but it will
be at our own proper peril, if we exercise our Freethought.&nbsp;
As sure as you do, so you <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>will suffer from it.&nbsp; It is not
the prophet or his warning that brings down the penalty, it is
not the book upon sanitary law that brings diptheria or scarlet
fever, it is not the sinking of the mercury in the glass that
brings the storm; the written proof in the one case, the mute
proof in the other, foretell the evil, but do not create
it.&nbsp; Nature and science, then, have their warnings, and
threatenings, and penalties; and nature and science avenge
themselves on Freethought.</p>
<p>And mark this, the more and more you lose sight of personal
will, the fainter and fainter seems to grow the chance of
forgiveness, less and less room there seems to be for
Freethought; there is something in the words, &ldquo;I believe in
God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,&rdquo; there
is something in the loving will that has power to save the
Freethought of his erring creatures from the soulless and
merciless machinery of law.</p>
<p>Now we see how little room there is for Freethought in this
world of law.&nbsp; Let us introduce into the world a fact; let
us introduce the idea of a God; let us suppose for the sake of
argument that there is a God.&nbsp; Can it be a matter of
indifference how he feels toward us, and how we should feel and
act toward him?&nbsp; How can there be a possibility of thought
without consequences as regards God, if there be no possibility
of thought without consequences as regards the very least of
God&rsquo;s works?&nbsp; Does it make no difference to us whether
he is an Almighty tyrant or a father to us, whether or not he can
suspend the terrible laws of nature which we dread?&nbsp; Can we
hear about this God, and not wish to learn all about him?&nbsp;
Can there be anything more absurd than the saying, Let us have
religion and no theology?&nbsp; Is that more sensible than to
say, Let us have sun, moon, and stars, and no astronomy; let us
have plants and no botany; let us have the earth and no
geology?&nbsp; If God be a fact, there must certainly come
theology out of that fact.&nbsp; As geology grows out of the fact
with which it deals, so does theology grow out of a fact.&nbsp;
Of all the errors of the time there cannot be a greater absurdity
than a religion without theology, for every religion teaches our
obligations to a higher being.&nbsp; If there be a God, there
must be a theology.&nbsp; I will ask you what is this creed of
Christendom?&nbsp; It is nearly all the assertion of facts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven
and earth, and in Jesus Christ his only son our Lord, who was
conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered
under Pontius Pilate, was <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>crucified, dead and buried; he
descended into hell, the third day he rose again from the dead;
he ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the
Father Almighty: from thence he shall come to judge the quick and
the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these assertions of facts you may say are not facts; but
if they be facts, you are bound to think rightly about
them.&nbsp; You are bound to think right about them under
penalties, but no more so than as to other facts.&nbsp; You are
as much bound to think right as to the fact of a God as to any
other fact.&nbsp; But men say, These facts are not so certain as
the facts of physical science.&nbsp; We answer, They are more
certain to us; they are to us facts as certain as the great
lights of heaven.&nbsp; We cannot conceive the possibility of
ourselves doubting them.&nbsp; We may say, Perhaps there is a
God, and we have a right to say, The perhaps may become a
certainty.&nbsp; If we think right, and you think wrong, you must
suffer the consequences.&nbsp; If a man of science puts into your
hand a book, and warns you of the danger of infection, and you
say you don&rsquo;t believe it, because you are sceptical about
the teaching, he cannot compel you to believe it, but meantime
you will suffer; the proof may come in sickness and in death, and
you will not escape.&nbsp; And we say, not in anger and
bitterness, not in hard denunciation of the wrath of
God&mdash;God forbid that we should do it; but we speak in the
same tone of warning, and not threatening, and we say, If you
doubt, remember time is passing, and if you think wrong, there is
danger of the judgment.&nbsp; We say, Take heed how you grope in
the dark and stumble.&nbsp; We cannot alter the facts if they are
facts, and they will affect your happiness.&nbsp; We say, There
is in this nothing uncharitable, no violation of Freethought any
more in religion than in science.&nbsp; We say that the
consequences of thinking erroneously in religion may be as
perilous as the consequences of thinking erroneously as to
physical facts.&nbsp; It remains to be shown what are the facts
of our religion.&nbsp; All that we say now is, that an error
about the facts may be fraught with serious consequences, and we
no more violate Freethought than when a physician warns you.</p>
<p>Now, then, I trust we have disposed of those prejudices that
lay upon the threshold of our inquiry, these prejudices against
Christianity as being opposed to Freethought; for if Freethought
means freedom as opposed to necessity, religion does not deny it;
if Freethought means freedom as opposed to authority, religion
does not create the distinction, it is <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>just as easy to reconcile it with
religion as with the state of society.&nbsp; If you mean by
Freethought, freedom without responsibility as to consequences,
there is no such thing either in society or in nature, and you
have no right to expect it in religion.&nbsp; All that we say is,
that we are not to expect freedom of thought without its
responsibility.&nbsp; Christianity gives us glimpses of the means
of escape from the operation of material laws in the mercies of
the loving Father of the human family.</p>

REPLY<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
MR. C. BRADLAUGH.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHRISTIANITY AND FREETHOUGHT.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Delivered in the Free
Library</i>, <i>Norwich</i>, <i>April</i> 3, 1871.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> on the 7th of February the
Very Reverend the Dean of Norwich issued his circular announcing
that a series of discourses would be delivered by &ldquo;some
competent preacher,&rdquo; &ldquo;having for their object the
vindication and establishment of the Christian faith,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;directed against modern forms of infidelity,&rdquo; I felt
deep interest, not I presume confined to the ranks of the party
which has permitted me to be its advocate upon this
occasion.&nbsp; The circular was in point of fact an announcement
that the Church of England felt it necessary to challenge and
give battle to modern infidelity; and that having determined that
the struggle should be a real one, it intended to select its best
man, and by his mouth to vindicate and establish the faith, which
modern infidelity is doing so much to undermine, not only in the
busy North, but even in the quiet and church-shadowed capital of
East Anglia.</p>
<p>When on my arrival in Norwich I learned that the influence of
the Dean and Chapter of this cathedral city had in no sense been
exerted to give me the sort of opportunity to be heard in reply
to their advocate, which I had a reasonable right to expect, and
when I knew that after our friends making a circuit of the city,
in the vain endeavour to hire a building meet for such an
occasion, it was difficult to ensure the use of the Free Library
Hall, I felt that even in Norwich the approved mode of
encountering modern infidelity seemed to be that of free speech
for the church advocate and gagged mouth for the pleader on
behalf of heresy.&nbsp; When I sat in the fine nave of the old
cathedral, and weighed the accessories of choir and organ,
intoned litany, and prayer responses instrumentally accompanied;
when I looked at the large <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>number of clergy present, headed by
two bishops, and supported by the wealth and fashion of the
district, I could not but feel that so far as mere scenic effects
went, our side was sadly lacking in such accessories to win
adhesion.&nbsp; When, too, I saw the selected &ldquo;competent
preacher,&rdquo; the Right Rev. Dr. Magee, Lord Bishop of
Peterborough, whose fame as an eloquent orator, an erudite and
polished disputant, has long since been widely spread, I knew
that our cause laboured under every possible disadvantage save
one.&nbsp; It had but its truth and justice.&nbsp; Prestige,
talent, skill, fashion, were allied to serve the Church.&nbsp;
When, moreover, I found that in the local press religious men,
headed by Church of England clergy, sought to excite prejudices
against me before even a word had been spoken on my side, I could
not help thinking that even if defeated in a struggle so unequal
it would leave the Church but little to boast of in its
victory.&nbsp; But I plead neither for mercy nor favour; fair
encounter has been asked and denied, and I take the risk of
battle.&nbsp; Although we are to-day the challenged, the Church
refuses tourney ground to our party, and we must contend as best
we can.</p>
<p>In treating the subject of &ldquo;Christianity and
Freethought,&rdquo; in reply to the address of the Bishop of
Peterborough, I am entitled to narrow, and shall narrow, the
question covered by this reply, to one merely between the
Freethinker and the Church of England Christian only.&nbsp; The
litany, hymns, and prayers which formed the preface to the
Bishop&rsquo;s advocacy are here fair weapons to use against
him.&nbsp; I do not stand here to-night to plead against Roman
Catholic Christianity, or against Wesleyan, Independent, or
Baptist nonconforming Christianity, nor do I plead against
Unitarian Christianity.&nbsp; I am here to reply to the Church
and State Christianity, the thirty-nine articles Christianity; to
the system with which the Lord Bishop of Peterborough has
identified his brilliant talents and great powers of speech, and
with all the faults and corruptions of which he must rest
burdened so far as this controversy is concerned.&nbsp; Here he
must not throw aside any one of the three Creeds, here every line
of the Prayer Book affects his teaching.&nbsp; The Christianity
he must defend is that which the 9 and 10 William IV., cap. 32,
maintains; the Christianity by law established.</p>
<p>I pass without comment the fact that the text selected by the
Lord Bishop was not only from the Gospel whose authenticity is
doubted by many Christians, but from a <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>chapter specially regarded as an
interpolated one.&nbsp; On this head, I leave Dr. Magee to debate
with Dr. Davidson.&nbsp; But I am bound to draw attention to the
very extraordinary exposition given of the contents of this
chapter, which we are invited to study.&nbsp; Dr. Magee says that
the people who were with Jesus, &ldquo;were doubtless drawn to
Christ by the fame of his miracles,&rdquo; and that when they
left him &ldquo;it was not that they doubted of his ability to
perform miracles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, so far as this chapter is
concerned, there is not the smallest particle of reference to
miracles at all, and, therefore, Dr. Magee&rsquo;s words on this
head, and even admitting his alleged authority, were only so much
foundationless verbiage.&nbsp; And when Dr. Magee says that this
chapter teaches that &ldquo;the religion of Christ was not
received unquestioningly, even in the case of his miracles, for
in spite of his miracles they ventured to question his
doctrine,&rdquo; I can only express my deep regret that the many
occupations of the Lord Bishop of Peterborough should have left
him without the time to master the actual contents of the chapter
on which his sermon was based.</p>
<p>Bishop Magee further urges that &ldquo;those who say that
Christianity was received in an ignorant age, are contradicted by
the story of Christianity itself, for many of those who saw his
miracles rejected them.&rdquo;&nbsp; I fail to see the
contradiction; clearly the Jews were an ignorant people, they had
no scientific literature, no philosophy, no recorded oratory, not
even a language&mdash;for the Hebrew is but that which the
captives borrowed from their captors&mdash;not a trace of their
ancient tongue having been preserved.</p>
<p>The learned Bishop argues that &ldquo;the desires, prejudices,
and passions of men largely share in the making of their
beliefs.&rdquo;&nbsp; But surely he might have carried this
farther still, and have shown&mdash;and this even apart from the
case made out by Darwin, Spencer, and Wallace&mdash;that race,
climate, soil, food, and mode of life, modify and change beliefs,
and that such beliefs are transmissible and transmitted from
parent to child in similar&mdash;though perhaps not in the
same&mdash;fashion as are features and frames.&nbsp; And as in
the case of the <i>physique</i> the inherited nature is modified,
improving or deteriorating with the mode of life of the
individual, so also, but in a more varied degree, with his
thought-abilities and his thoughts.&nbsp; But if it be true, as
was so powerfully urged by the Right Reverend Christian Advocate,
that men&rsquo;s desires, passions, and prejudices contribute
largely to <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>the making up of their beliefs, what becomes of his
Lordship&rsquo;s subsequent startling declaration that a man is
free to choose what he will believe, &ldquo;to will his own
belief?&rdquo;&nbsp; If there are hereditary predispositions to
particular lines of thought, hereditary predispositions to regard
particular topics from limited stand-points, hereditary
predispositions to ignore or accept unquestioningly particular
propositions, I ask, Does not the acquiescence in such a doctrine
fatally impeach the Bishop&rsquo;s arguments?</p>
<p>On the reference made to the &ldquo;bigotry of the
priest,&rdquo; I desire in this lecture to say but little, for I
would willingly follow the example of my Right Reverend
antagonist, and entirely avoid those arguments which savour of
mere personal denunciation; but it is hard to forget that during
the 1800 years which, it was boasted, Christianity has endured it
was the policy and practice of priestly bigotry, first in the
Church of Rome, and afterwards, and not less, in the Church of
England, to oppose, and without mercy to seek to crush out all
efforts at Freethought.&nbsp; If to-day the Lord Bishop of
Peterborough lifts his powerful and eloquent voice in the
Cathedral nave, if to-day we are charmed with his suasive
pleading and well-turned periods, we can scarcely forget that it
is only since the Church has been unable to strike with the arm
of the law that she has condescended to plead with the
tongue.</p>
<p>I must assume to-night that those of you who are present were
also present at the Bishop&rsquo;s discourse; but I speak with
more freedom as it is my intention to print this reply together
with a <i>verbatim</i> report of the Lord Bishop&rsquo;s sermon,
so that they may stand side by side.&nbsp; I regret that the
learned and eloquent advocate of Church Christianity did not
think it right when talking of freedom, necessity, laws of
nature, absolute freedom, and so forth, to favour us with some
explanation or definition to guide us to the sense he intended to
convey by their use; as I could not help fancying that he more
than once used the same words with quite different
meanings.&nbsp; Jonathan Edwards, whom I shall quote to you with
slight modification, thus in effect states the doctrine of
necessity:&mdash;&ldquo;The whole universe exhibits a fixed,
certain, and constant succession of events, which bear to each
other the relation of causes and effects.&nbsp; This series of
causes and effects, as they belong to unconscious and involuntary
subjects, is the physical order of the material universe: of
which order the phenomena are found by observation <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>to take place
according to certain principles, which are usually called the
laws of nature.&nbsp; This series, as it applies to intelligent
and voluntary agents, consists of the fixed and invariable
conjunction of volitions and voluntary actions with antecedent
motives.&nbsp; In every instance that we know by experience, or
that we can conceive, there is an invariable and necessary
conjunction of motives and volitions.&nbsp; We cannot conceive a
change in the volition without an antecedent change in the
motive; and the motives remaining the same, the volitions and the
voluntary acts will be correspondent.&nbsp; We are conscious that
we never do, and never can, perform any voluntary action without
a motive.&rdquo;&nbsp; While not adopting entirely the words of
Jonathan Edwards, I have given his view of the doctrine of
necessity, a view not contained in the sermon by Bishop Magee;
but each used the phrase laws of nature.&nbsp; Now, clearly, in
the mouth of the Bishop, law meant the expression of personal
will.&nbsp; The Duke of Argyll in his &ldquo;Reign of Law,&rdquo;
says:&mdash;&ldquo;In its primary signification a
&lsquo;law&rsquo; is the authoritative expression of human will
enforced by power;&rdquo; but he gives five different senses in
which the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; is used.&nbsp; First, &ldquo;We
have law as applied simply to an observed order of facts;
secondly, to that order as involving the action of some force or
forces of which nothing more may be known; thirdly, as applied to
individual forces, the measure of whose operation has been more
or less defined or ascertained; fourthly, as applied to those
combinations of force which have reference to the fulfilment of
purpose, or the discharge of function; fifthly, as applied to
abstract conceptions of the mind, not corresponding with any
actual phenomena, but deduced therefrom as axioms of thought
necessary to our understanding of them.&nbsp; Law, in this sense,
is a reduction of the phenomena, not merely to an order of facts,
but to an order of thought.&rdquo;&nbsp; I use law only as
denoting observed concurrence or sequence of events.&nbsp; When
it is said to be a law that water poured from the glass shall
fall to the ground, it is not, or should not, be meant that the
water falls by command emanating from personal will, but only
that this is the recorded experience of all competent observers
without exception.&nbsp; Jonathan Edwards, relying on Isaiah
xlvi. 9 and 10, xiv. 27, Acts xv. 18, Psalms xxxiii. 10 and 11,
and other texts, declared that the absolute and perfect
foreknowledge of God, asserted in the Bible, was inconsistent
with freedom of volition, as it implied the certainty of the
happening of the <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>events foreknown.&nbsp; The Duke of Argyll says,
&ldquo;There is nothing to object to or deny in the doctrine that
if we knew everything that determines the conduct of a man, we
should be able to know what the conduct will be.&nbsp; That is to
say, if we knew all the motives which are brought by external
agencies to bear upon his mind, and if we knew all the other
motives which that mind evolves out of its own powers, and out of
previously acquired materials, to bear upon itself; and if we
knew the character and disposition of that mind so perfectly as
to estimate exactly the weight it will allow to all the different
motives operating upon it, then we should be able to predict with
certainty the resulting course of conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir
William Hamilton, for I prefer to quote from antagonists, says,
&ldquo;How the will can possibly be free, must remain to us,
under the present limitation of our faculties, wholly
incomprehensible.&nbsp; We are unable to conceive an absolute
commencement, we cannot, therefore, conceive a free
volition.&nbsp; A determination by motives cannot, to our
understanding, escape from necessitation.&nbsp; Nay, were we even
to admit as true what we cannot think as possible, still the
doctrine of a motiveless volition would be only casualism; and
the free acts of an indifferent, are, morally and rationally, as
worthless as the pre-ordered passions of a determined will.&nbsp;
How, therefore, I repeat, moral liberty is possible in man or
God, we are utterly unable, speculatively, to
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In dealing with &ldquo;Freedom as opposed to Necessity,&rdquo;
Dr. Magee declared &ldquo;that a man is free to think in one way
or another, that it is not absolutely necessary for him always to
think in one way or another.&rdquo;&nbsp; This declaration is so
obscure, that I should have had to abandon all attempt to solve
the Bishop&rsquo;s meaning but for the added
explanation&mdash;viz., &ldquo;that is to say, his thought is not
the necessary product of physical constitution, that his thoughts
do not grow out of him, as the blade grows out of the seed or the
flower out of the plant, that it is not mechanical or necessary,
but that a man has the power to choose how he will
think.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not imagine that Dr. Magee used the word
&ldquo;thought&rdquo; as limited by Sir William Hamilton; or that
he intended in the loose words he uttered on this head to examine
the doctrine as to evolution of thought put forward by German
thinkers.&nbsp; I assume that the Lord Bishop regarded brilliancy
of speech as preferable to profundity of argument, and fancied
that he would best clear the way for the other Christian
advocates <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>who are to follow him, by piling well-sounding but often
perfectly unmeaning phrases in their pathway.&nbsp; When the
Bishop of Peterborough urges that thought is not the necessary
product of physical constitution, we answer by opening before him
an ethnical map; and pointing to the Australian as probably the
lowest human type, the Bushman of the Cape, the Esquimaux, the
Negro, the Teuton, we ask whether physical constitution has not
something to do with thought-ability?&nbsp; Nay, taking a
mal-formed cranium or a diseased brain from a lunatic asylum, we
demand further whether the unhealthy and inaccurate thought is
not there alleged in precise terms to be the &ldquo;necessary
product of physical constitution?&rdquo;&nbsp; The assertion
&ldquo;that a man has the power to choose how he will
think,&rdquo; may be met by the query&mdash;When?&nbsp; Has the
old man, partly deaf, partly blind, with failing memory, the
power to choose how he will think?&nbsp; Has the drunken man,
while intoxicated, the power to choose how he will think?&nbsp;
Has the untaught Norfolk farm labourer with Sir W.
Hamilton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Philosophy of the Unconditioned&rdquo;
before him, the power to choose how he will think in opposition
to or in support of Cousin or Kant?&nbsp; Has the man to whom
Church of England Christianity was taught as a child, whose
intellect was bent and bound while yet pliable and scarce
resisting, whose scope of inquiry has always been restrained by
that line where reason applied becomes blasphemy, has he the
power to choose what he will think?&nbsp; Let the wretched
subterfuges with which even thinkers above the average&mdash;as
your Essayists and Reviewers, your Dunbar Heaths, your Drs. Giles
and Irons, your Colensos and your Voyseys&mdash;try to reconcile
orthodoxy and Freethought, be examined, and you will have fuller
answer than any I can give.&nbsp; Has man the power to choose how
he will think?&nbsp; It may be fairly presumed, that under the
words &ldquo;to think,&rdquo; Dr. Magee included all phases of
mental activity, perception, recollection of perception,
comparison of perception, judgment, reason, volition.&nbsp; Any
word by which any condition of mental activity could be fairly
described is, I take leave to submit, included by Dr. Magee under
the head of &ldquo;thought.&rdquo;&nbsp; But is it true that a
man can choose his perceptions?&nbsp; Are they not first limited
by his perceptive ability, and, next, by the range within which
that ability can be exercised, and its development in
exercise?&nbsp; And if perception be compulsory, if a man cannot
refuse to perceive that which is within the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>range of his
ability, if he cannot elect to perceive that which is not within
its range, then how can the thought-processes&mdash;all related
to, and more or less based upon, the primary perceptions,
modified or enlarged as these may afterwards be&mdash;how can
these be free?&nbsp; And will Dr. Magee contend that a man has
the power to choose what he will remember, or what he will
forget?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; says Dr. Magee, &ldquo;teaches
that man is free, and terribly free, to will his own
belief;&rdquo; but the tenth article of Dr. Magee&rsquo;s own
Church, an article which binds him in this argument, declares
that &ldquo;The condition of man after the fall of Adam is such,
that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural
strength and good works, to faith and calling upon God;&rdquo;
nay, the very Litany in which the Lord Bishop took part proceeds
on the assumption that all are miserable sinners, who may desire
to escape, but cannot escape, from sin without God&rsquo;s
help.&nbsp; And the ninth article of the Church of England
positively declares that every man &ldquo;is of his own nature
inclined to evil, so that the flesh always lusteth contrary to
the spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where there is absolute
freedom,&rdquo; says my Lord Bishop of Peterborough, &ldquo;there
cannot be authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; But man is absolutely,
&ldquo;terribly free&rdquo; to choose his belief, therefore this
is a subject upon which God can have no authority.&nbsp; This is
a point upon which the power of the Omnipotent is limited.&nbsp;
This being monstrously absurd, it was natural that the acute
advocate for a falling Church should make some effort to retreat
with the honours of war, and he, admitting the difficulty in
religion, says that you find precisely the same difficulty in
politics in fact, and in law, medicine, and morality, as to
opinion.&nbsp; Arguments from analogy are dangerous at best, but
here there is no analogy.&nbsp; Dr. Magee should at least read
the &ldquo;Contrat Social&rdquo; of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and
the exhaustive essay on Liberty by John Stuart Mill.&nbsp; No one
but a madman would contend in politics either for the absolute
liberty of the individual, or for the absolute supremacy of
authority.&nbsp; Even Guizot&rsquo;s views of government might
have saved Bishop Magee from an illustration so faulty.&nbsp; And
as to the opinions on law and medicine which we receive
submissively from lawyer and doctor, their authority is usually
the measure of our ignorance.&nbsp; We swallow the drugs of Dr.
Pangloss, and bow to the dictum of Justice Shallow, it is true;
but the more we know of physiology, the more we learn of
jurisprudence, <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>the less is our acquiescence a mere submission to
authority.</p>
<p>As to so much of the Bishop&rsquo;s sermon as deals with the
authority of revelation and miracles, and which in effect
declares that, on the authority of a revelation not made to me, I
may be required to believe in Jesus Christ as the &ldquo;only
son&rdquo; of God, while that very revelation tells me that God
had more than one son&mdash;(Job i. 6, ii. 1)&mdash;and which on
the authority of miracles disbelieved by the mass of the people
who are supposed to have seen them, requires me to believe that
Jesus, &ldquo;very God of very God,&rdquo; having descended into
hell, afterwards ascended into heaven with &ldquo;his body,
flesh, and bones, and all things appertaining to man&rsquo;s
nature,&rdquo; and there sits at the right hand of
God&mdash;(Article four and Nicene Creed)&mdash;my answer is a
very simple one.&nbsp; The Bishop&rsquo;s declaration that here
no tyranny is attempted over Freethought is not a fair and honest
declaration.&nbsp; The revelation does not submit its proof to
Freethought, but, on the contrary, my Lord Bishop of
Peterborough, as the spokesman of his Church, is bound to tell us
in the words of his own horrible creed, that the man who will not
submit to acknowledge the dogmas of his Church, without doubt
shall perish everlastingly.</p>
<p>When the Bishop says that men are continually submitting to
authority, and that if they did not they would never learn
anything, he is woefully inaccurate in his analogy.&nbsp; It is
perfectly true that Humboldt, Lyell, Huxley, Darwin, Lewes,
Spencer, Mill, and such men&rsquo;s names are names of authority,
and that our experience is supplemented and aided by the recorded
experiences of such men.&nbsp; But our confidence is not an
unlimited one, their authority is not supreme.&nbsp; It is
limited by the measure of our own experience in the first place,
and by our acquaintance with the experience of other men than
these in the next; both of these, too, modified and affected by
our general intellectual ability.&nbsp; But all that our
scientific teachers say is, We have learned such and such things,
we learned them in such a fashion, you may if you have leisure
and means verify our experiments, we show you the road we have
travelled, we have mapped and scaled it for you.&nbsp; But in
religion there is no such teaching, the authority of the Church
dominates, denies, and annihilates experience with a graveyard
resurrection for lack of living verification.&nbsp; Nothing could
more fittingly be denounced as a trick of pulpit advocacy had it
come from the mouth of any other <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>man, than the supposition of an
impossible event in a graveyard as evidence on some equally
impossible doctrine.&nbsp; It would be far more natural in
thought to suppose deception in the alleged graveyard conjuring,
than to suppose anything else.&nbsp; For decomposing bodies,
fleshless skeletons, forms in which the vital organisation had
been destroyed, and disappearing for days, weeks, months, or
years, to suddenly break through coffins, which living they would
have been unable to burst, to get through a superincumbent mass
of earth, and to stand out in flesh, alive, the blood circulating
through newly manufactured veins&mdash;a man who saw this instead
of crying &ldquo;A miracle,&rdquo; had far better believe himself
subject to delirium, and make his straightway to the nearest
physician for medicine to cool his disordered brain.&nbsp; But
the Bishop&rsquo;s case is weaker still; his graveyard opened
1800 years ago, the men who saw it have ever rejected it, and we
who have not even seen it are required to believe it, and are
told, that in this there is no tyranny over our thought.&nbsp;
When the Bishop talks of the &ldquo;soulless and merciless
machinery of law,&rdquo; and declares that &ldquo;there are no
laws so merciless as those of nature,&rdquo; we must not forget
that by the very terms of his sermon, and by the creed of his
Church, he asserts all law as the expression of the
&ldquo;personal will&rdquo; of Deity; and the soulless and
merciless law is, according to the Lord Bishop of Peterborough,
the manifested will of the merciful God who is infinite soul and
love.&nbsp; Reading to us a portion of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed,
Dr. Magee said, All these are assertions of facts, and &ldquo;you
are bound to think right about them under penalties,&rdquo; but
not more so than about other alleged matters of fact.&nbsp; This
is untrue.&nbsp; What other alleged matters of fact are men
required to believe under Act of Parliament?&nbsp; What other
alleged facts are there which if a man deny he may be sent to
gaol, lose civil rights, be denied the guardianship of his
children, and be made an outlaw in the State?&nbsp; Where of an
alleged fact in astronomy or geology is your investigation
prefaced with the declaration that if you deny it you shall be
sent to a bottomless pit filled with brimstone and fire, and
prepared for the Devil and his angels?</p>
<h2><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>SECOND
DISCOURSE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHRISTIANITY AND SCEPTICISM.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Wednesday evening, March 29th,
the Bishop of Peterborough preached his second sermon, on
&ldquo;Christianity and Scepticism,&rdquo; before a large
congregation in the nave of the Cathedral, Norwich.&nbsp; His
text was from the Gospel according to St. John, xx.
25:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The other disciples therefore said unto
him, We have seen the Lord.&nbsp; But he said unto them, Except I
shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger
into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I
will not believe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His Lordship said:</p>
<blockquote><p>My subject to-night is &ldquo;Christianity, and
Scepticism,&rdquo; and I have chosen for my text these words of a
sceptic, for as such St. Thomas has been regarded.&nbsp; His name
has become proverbial in Church history for unbelief.&nbsp; Among
the different characters that surround our Lord in the Gospel
story, he has been regarded as the type of the doubter, and he is
known as the doubting or the unbelieving Thomas.&nbsp; And yet at
first sight we hardly see that he should be so called.&nbsp; It
is quite true that he did doubt, and yet his doubt does not at
first sight seem to be unreasonable, or so very obstinate that he
should be called by way of distinction, the doubter, the
unbeliever.&nbsp; It was not unreasonable.&nbsp; On the contrary,
it was reasonable and natural that he should feel some doubt
about the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Others had doubts
as well as he, and they were called fools and slow of heart to
believe, and yet they did not inherit the name of the
doubters.&nbsp; Again, his disbelief was not of a very obstinate
kind.&nbsp; It seemed to have yielded almost instantaneously; and
almost immediately after he was satisfied, he said more than
others of the disciples, for he said &ldquo;My Lord and my
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He not only acknowledged the resurrection of
Jesus, but his divinity, and yet he is called Thomas the doubter,
the sceptic, and he is rightly so called.</p>
<p>The Christian consciousness did not err when it gave the name,
because when he uttered the words which I have just read to you,
&ldquo;Except I see I will not believe,&rdquo; he uttered that
which is the very essence of scepticism.&nbsp; He suspended his
belief upon an absolutely impossible condition.&nbsp; He declared
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>that he
would not give his assent except on this condition, that it
should be made absolutely impossible for him to doubt.&nbsp; What
he said to his brother disciples amounts to
this:&mdash;&ldquo;You tell me that you have seen the Lord, but I
cannot believe you.&nbsp; It does not matter to me how strong
your testimony may be, or how truthful I believe you to be, I
will not be satisfied till I see it for myself.&nbsp; I will not
accept of any testimony but that of my own senses.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He said his assent was only to be had by absolute demonstration,
and its being made impossible for him to have any doubt.&nbsp; I
say the condition makes all belief absolutely impossible.&nbsp;
Belief, in the proper sense of the word, is assent on an amount
of trust.&nbsp; If we have absolute demonstration of anything,
the result is not belief at all, it is demonstration.&nbsp; What
we see with the eyes of our body or mind, we don&rsquo;t properly
believe in.&nbsp; We know it.&nbsp; We have the certainty, not of
faith, but of science, and where doubt is impossible, belief or
faith is impossible.&nbsp; You may have certainty, but it will be
the certainty of knowledge, it will not be the certainty of
faith.&nbsp; It is quite clear that if any man makes it a
condition of his assent to truth of any kind, that it must first
be demonstrated to him as clear as that two and two make four; it
is clear that is if there be any class of truths which cannot be
so proved as that two and two make four, the man who makes that
proof or demonstration a condition of his assent, must always be
in doubt about those truths, or that class of truths; he must
always in respect of them be a sceptic or doubter.</p>
<p>Again, one step further, it is clear that religion or
Christianity is a truth, or class of truths that cannot be
demonstrated scientifically.&nbsp; We cannot prove that there is
a God, in the same way that we can prove that two and two make
four.&nbsp; We cannot do this, because the idea of God is that he
is invisible to us.&nbsp; The first utterance of religion is
this: I believe in what I cannot see, I believe in an invisible
God.&nbsp; Clearly he that says, I don&rsquo;t believe anything I
do not see, must be a sceptic or doubter about the truth of
religion; and therefore it comes to pass, that though religion is
by no means the only subject, or the only collection of truths
that cannot be demonstrated, it is the principal one, and it has
come to pass that though there are sceptics on other subjects,
yet for this reason a sceptic is understood to be a man who
doubts about religious subjects; a man who will not believe all
the truths of Christianity, because they cannot be demonstrated
to him in the way he thinks they should be demonstrated.&nbsp;
You see <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>now what a sceptic is, and what scepticism, is.&nbsp; By
the word sceptic we mean a disbeliever in the truths of
religion.&nbsp; A man may disbelieve some of the truths of
religion and not be a sceptic.&nbsp; A Jew does not believe in
Christianity, but he is not a sceptic.&nbsp; It is because he
believes in Moses that he does not believe in Christ.&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t call the Pantheists or the Deists sceptics, because
they have a fixed belief.&nbsp; Some of their beliefs I think
monstrous; they make a greater demand on faith than those do who
believe in religion.&nbsp; I think the man who says there is no
God must believe more contradictions than the man who says there
is a God.&nbsp; He has a perfectly monstrous creed, but it is a
creed.&nbsp; He is not so much a disbeliever as a misbeliever,
for he believes in something else than God.&nbsp; Again, we
don&rsquo;t call a doubter a sceptic; a sceptic is a doubter, but
the doubter is not necessarily a sceptic.&nbsp; A man may doubt
of the truths of religion, only because he has not had evidence
of the proper kind.&nbsp; A sceptic asks for evidence of an
unreasonable kind.&nbsp; A man may doubt the truth of any
assertion in history; he may think that all the historians or
witnesses of the facts are untruthful or ill informed, I should
not call that man a sceptic; but if a man said, I don&rsquo;t
believe the facts you allege in history, because I deny all human
testimony; you cannot deny that these men lived some time since,
and that they may have been liars; you cannot give me proof to
the contrary: that man I should call a sceptic, because in
matters historical he was demanding an unreasonable amount of
evidence.&nbsp; It is not doubt nor unbelief that makes the
difference as to the sceptic.&nbsp; The sceptic is not such
because he doubts, but on account of the reason of his
doubt.&nbsp; He seeks for evidence that it is not proper or
reasonable that he should have.</p>
<p>Now I have shown you that there may be doubt without
scepticism; and on the other hand, there may be belief, or at
least assent, upon sceptical principles.&nbsp; It is quite
possible that a man may be firmly persuaded of some of the truths
of religion, and yet be in heart a sceptic.&nbsp; If a man were
to say I cannot believe in the existence of a God till I have it
demonstrated to me as clear as that the three angles of a
triangle are equal to two right angles, then he is in principle a
sceptic, because it is clear that if he could not have that sort
of proof, he would begin to doubt of the existence of God.&nbsp;
All the time his assent to the existence of God would not have
rested upon any faith or trust, but upon demonstration.&nbsp; <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>But when the
idea of God ceased to be a scientific certainty, it is clear that
he would be in heart a sceptic.&nbsp; And there is no doubt that
the first belief of the apostle Thomas was rendered upon
sceptical principles.&nbsp; He said, I will not believe till I
put my finger in the print of the nails, &amp;c., as if he had
said, I will believe nothing but the evidence of my own
senses.&nbsp; He believed only because he got this evidence of
his senses; and mark this, when our Lord gave him what he asked,
he pronounced no praise on his belief; he did not say to him as
he said to another, &ldquo;Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonas, for
flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee;&rdquo; but flesh
and blood had revealed the fact to Thomas, and our Lord said,
&ldquo;Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus it is possible to doubt without being
sceptical, and it is possible to assent, and to be still
sceptical.&nbsp; I want you to dwell on this point of belief,
doubt, and sceptical belief, because there are certain things
that I am going to point out in this way.&nbsp; I ask you to test
for yourselves what I am now going to say, and try the effect
upon your own feelings.&nbsp; We cannot demonstrate
Christianity.&nbsp; It is utterly impossible that I can give you
a demonstration of Christianity, such as will leave no possible
room for doubt or question.&nbsp; When those who have to follow
me have said all they have to say; when they have put before you
all the evidences of Christianity in all their fulness and
variety; when they have shown how much more reasonable it is to
believe than to disbelieve, how many more difficulties there are
in the way of disbelief than of belief; when all this is done,
there may still be a doubt on your minds; there will be questions
that cannot be answered, there will be difficulties that cannot
be explained, and which no living man can explain.&nbsp; We can
give the highest degree of evidence, short of demonstration, for
belief in Christ, but we cannot demonstrate Christianity.&nbsp;
Now what effect has that announcement on your hearts?&nbsp;
Possibly you have heard it with some disappointment.&nbsp; You
may have come to hear these sermons, expecting to have all your
doubts removed.&nbsp; You may say, &ldquo;I thought you were
going to answer all the questions with mathematical
certainty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our answer is, If we could prove with as
much certainty that there is a God as that two and two make four,
or as that this is a book [holding it up], then our religion
would do you as much good as the knowledge that two and two make
four.&nbsp; We would not in that case cultivate the <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>quality of
faith in your souls, in spite of difficulties and doubts.&nbsp;
We cannot demonstrate Christianity, but we can give sufficient
reason for our belief in it, in spite of doubt.</p>
<p>What we have to say is this, that the evidences of
Christianity are weapons to put in the hands of every one of you,
with which every man and woman may fight out in his or her
innermost soul the desolating and besieging doubt that from time
to time will assault it.&nbsp; This is the real object of
evidences of faith, but they are not meant to be the outlying
works of the citadel of the soul outside of which the enemy is
compelled to keep.&nbsp; The shield of faith in God you have to
carry on your own arm, and with it quench all the fiery darts of
the wicked one.&nbsp; Though your own arm tremble, you must carry
it to repel the darts that are aimed at your own heart.</p>
<p>There is another word of comfort we have to give you the
really distressed doubter.&nbsp; Christianity does not repel the
doubter who says, I believe, Lord help my unbelief.&nbsp; What
Christianity is intolerant of is not doubt, but the spirit of
doubt, not unbelief, but the demand for unreasonable, impossible
conditions of belief.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t tell you to stamp out
every doubt before you can become a Christian.&nbsp; We say if
you believe but one point, you may come to believe all the rest,
and our message to you is, weary as you may be of the load of
doubt, the same as that of the Saviour who said &ldquo;Come unto
me all you that are weary and heavy laden,&rdquo; and you will
find rest to your souls.</p>
<p>And now I have clearly explained the difference between
Christianity and Scepticism.&nbsp; Let us briefly sum up again
and show the points of collision between Scepticism and
Christianity.&nbsp; We saw last night that the question between
Christianity and Freethought was a dispute as to the nature of
liberty, so the question between Christianity and Scepticism is a
dispute as to the nature of certainty.&nbsp; Christianity offers
and gives certainty in the end; Scepticism demands
certainty.&nbsp; But the certainty of Christianity is partly the
certainty of reason and partly of faith and of experience.&nbsp;
The certainty demanded by Scepticism is the certainty of science
only.&nbsp; The most extreme of unbelievers will admit that there
is something to be said for Christianity; and that it is not
unworthy of a hearing as regards its evidences.&nbsp; The men who
have believed in Christianity for the last 1800 years, have not
been the greatest fools in the world.&nbsp; Liebnitz and Butler
were not drivellers, and not those only, but hundreds and
thousands of the <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>greatest intellects that humanity has produced.&nbsp;
They were not such utter fools that any man is entitled to
dismiss Christianity with a wave of his hand.&nbsp; On the other
hand, every reasonable Christian will admit that there is
something fair and reasonable in some of the objections to
Christianity.&nbsp; But the Christian says to the sceptic, It is
unreasonable in you to ask that every difficulty should be got
rid of and every question answered before you believe in
Christianity.&nbsp; The sceptic replies, It is unreasonable in
you to ask me to believe in Christianity till you have removed
every doubt.&nbsp; I will ask you which is the reasonable
demand&mdash;the demand of the Christian for faith upon probable
evidence, or the demand of the sceptic for assent only upon
scientific demonstration?</p>
<p>Now in order to argue it fairly and without passion or
prejudice, let us pass from the subject of religious doubt and
let us consider the case of doubt in other matters than religion;
we all know that men have doubted in other subjects.&nbsp; Try
then to recall to your minds the first doubt; it was only a
little later than the first belief.&nbsp; The first instinct of
the child is to believe everything, that everything he sees and
hears is true.&nbsp; All appearances to the child are
realities.&nbsp; The sun is to him a ball of fire that climbs up
the sky, the stars are little specks of light that shine at
night.&nbsp; The earth is a flat plain.&nbsp; Very soon the child
learns the first great lesson of doubt, learns that things are
not what they appear to be, learns to distrust appearances,
learns that under the appearances there is a reality.&nbsp; He
gets his first teaching from doubt, and all-important is the
instinct of doubt.&nbsp; Very soon is the awakening of the
sceptical part of the mental nature of man, of his
understanding.&nbsp; The nature of the understanding is ever to
ask, What and why?&nbsp; The spirit of doubt leads the man from
question to question, from step to step, till he gets answers to
his questions; he goes on from doubt to belief, and from belief
to doubt, and so on to greater knowledge.&nbsp; Thus doubt is the
means of knowledge, the instrument of discovery.&nbsp; Without
the instinct of doubt humanity would be stagnant; with it alone
humanity progresses.&nbsp; I do not disparage doubt, I highly
value it; but doubt is useful on one condition, and one only,
that it starts from a first belief.&nbsp; What is the cause of
all this doubt and pursuit of knowledge?&nbsp; The supreme
instinctive belief, that under all appearances there is a
reality, that something underlies and causes all being; and it is
the search for this essence of existence that <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>leads the
doubter on, the search of this <i>I am</i>.&nbsp; If he had no
faith in some underlying reality beneath these phenomena, there
would be no progress, and so doubt is ever seeking for that which
is below what appears, and yet never reaches it.</p>
<p>Never yet has science reached to the great reason of all
reasons, to the great cause of all causes, that underlies all
knowledge; and yet ever as we seek for it we are advancing in
knowledge.&nbsp; We do not reach it, but are ever reaching and
passing on, through that which lies between us and it.&nbsp;
Doubt is like the mainspring of a watch, it is ever seeking to
uncoil itself and yet never entirely doing so.&nbsp; The result
is that the hands of the watch move uniformly because there is an
attachment of the mainspring.&nbsp; Cut the attachment, and the
hands will give one wild whirl and all will be still, and the
watch useless.&nbsp; It is just the same with doubt and
faith.&nbsp; Doubt is attached to the primary belief that there
is a cause of all things, but it is ever seeking to detach itself
from that belief and never succeeds.&nbsp; The consequence is,
that there is a constant and measured progress of the human
mind.&nbsp; But we have to consider how much further the
intellect which has thus been the rule and test of our belief
might go.&nbsp; A child not only believes in appearances or
facts, but he has an instinctive belief in the truthfulness of
humanity.&nbsp; The child has not learned that it is not wise to
believe everything that is said to him.&nbsp; Was that a happy
discovery?&nbsp; Should we tell a child not to believe the word
of any human being until he had demonstration about it?&nbsp; Is
it wisdom always to distrust human nature?&nbsp; We are always
trusting.&nbsp; Give a logical proof that we are right in any of
our trusts.&nbsp; A wife may be false, a child may hate its
parents, and a man may be robbed by a friend or a confidential
servant; yet are we to distrust everybody?&nbsp; If a man were
not to trust any one till it was proved by demonstration that he
ought to do so, he would be put in a lunatic asylum; and rightly
so, as a man one part of whose nature had got diseased and had
mastered all the other parts of his nature.&nbsp; I defy any one
to say logically that the man may not be right, or to give a
logical demonstration that it is absolutely impossible that his
wife, children, and friend were not in a conspiracy to wrong
him.&nbsp; There is thus an absolute necessity for trust in the
ordinary affairs of life, I hope you will see that life must be
conducted on the principle of faith or trust.</p>
<p>Let us ask if morality can exist without faith or trust,
whether we can get a demonstrative or scientific basis for
morality itself?&nbsp; <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>I ask this, because those who ask for
the destruction of our religion talk of the gain to
morality.&nbsp; They say, Sweep away the influences of religion
and morality will be stronger.&nbsp; Let us see how morality will
bear the assaults of scepticism.&nbsp; Morality is that code or
rule of action which we follow in questions of right or wrong, or
it is that code of right and wrong which every man adopts for
himself.&nbsp; To take the first definition.&nbsp; Have we got
the universal sense of humanity upon any moral question of right
or wrong?&nbsp; If the majority of mankind agree with us, can we
prove logically that they must always be right and the minority
wrong?&nbsp; Again, which morality will we have&mdash;that of
to-day or that of a past generation?&nbsp; If we cannot settle
the question by majority or minority, how are we to settle
it?&nbsp; By asking the opinion of the wise and good.&nbsp;
Before we know the wise and good we must know what wisdom and
goodness are; and if we know what they are, what need have we to
look to the wise and good to tell us?&nbsp; Who are the wise and
good?&nbsp; Those who gave good opinions.&nbsp; Is that
logical?&nbsp; Will it stand sceptical inquiry?&nbsp; If it is
not to be settled by the appeal to the universal voice of
humanity&mdash;which is simply illogical and preposterous, for
this reason, that we are part of universal humanity, and if we
differ from that verdict it is not the verdict of universal
humanity, and if we agree with it, we might as well have taken
our own in the first instance&mdash;then man must decide for
himself what is right and wrong.&nbsp; What is it decides in a
man what is right or wrong?&nbsp; Conscience.&nbsp; Why must a
man submit to the decision of his own conscience?&nbsp; We are
told that it is part of our moral nature.&nbsp; What
demonstration is there that one part of our nature is to yield to
another?&nbsp; Have we any logical demonstration as to what we
are?&nbsp; I have a scientific demonstration that I am made of
carbon, lime, phosphate, and certain other chemicals, but no man
of science has ever demonstrated spirit or conscience.&nbsp; Why
is it that a man is to obey the bidding of one convolution of his
brain more than another?&nbsp; It cannot be made as clear as that
two and two make four, that a man is to do to another man as he
would be done unto.&nbsp; Duty and right are words of the spirit,
of the soul, but science and logic never yet revealed the
soul.</p>
<p>Therefore the man who will believe nothing but what can be
demonstrated to him, will deny at last the obligation of duty in
obedience to his sceptical intellect, just as he <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>began with
denying the existence of God.&nbsp; How does he get out of this
great difficulty?&nbsp; By calling up the instinct of
faith.&nbsp; He wills to believe that he is something more than a
bundle of material elements, that the conscience in his soul is
something supreme and divine, that the man in him is something
above the animal; and by an exercise of faith in his own higher
and better self, he silences the eternal <i>why</i> of the
sceptical intellect, the serpent more subtile than any other
beast of the field, which if it had its way would make man a
beast.</p>
<p>There is only one more question to which I have to call your
attention.&nbsp; Having shown you that the sceptical intellect is
not the only judge, having shown you that there are domains of
human knowledge and human life into which, if it comes at all, it
must come as the servant and not as the master; having shown you
that scepticism is really nothing else than the intrusion of the
mere understanding into the province of the soul and the spirit,
it remains to ask, Is religion, is Christianity, one of those
subjects on which the understanding is not to be the only judge,
but on which the spirit and soul and heart of man have something
to say about his belief?&nbsp; Surely then if Christianity be
what it professes to be, a life, like all human and temporal
life, it must be conducted upon a principle of faith or
trust.&nbsp; If we cannot live our ordinary human life without
trust, where we cannot have certainty, neither can we live the
spiritual life without trust, where we can neither prove nor
demonstrate; then if we think of this life in close relationship
with the divine and the infinite life, can it possibly be
otherwise than that out of the meeting place of those two
mysteries there shall grow mystery and difficulty?&nbsp; All that
Christianity requires is, not that man shall not ask for
reasonable proof, but that we should not deal with it in a
different way from that in which we deal with human life and
morality.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t ask you in religion to believe
without evidence, but to require large evidence.&nbsp; Now my
friends, still remember when we ask you to believe before you see
all, it is that you may experience all.&nbsp; Christianity has a
certainty, but it comes not as the proof, but as the reward of
faith.&nbsp; There is a demonstration of the spirit, an evidence
of divine life, in the soul of the Christian, that he cannot
demonstrate to others, because it is as invisible as his own soul
and spirit, and yet it fills the inner core of the
spirit&mdash;it is the strengthener of the spirit.&nbsp;
Christianity is a great experiment, a probable experiment, a
reasonable experiment, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>but still it is an experiment, and
you may try it.&nbsp; If you have a simple and earnest desire to
ascertain its truth, try it, casting aside the trivial interests
that the profligate man has in the disproof of it.&nbsp; Try it
and see if there does not come into your soul that conviction not
created by science, but springing from the inner life of the
soul, that shall be like a well of water springing up to
everlasting life.&nbsp; As in life so in religion, &ldquo;blessed
are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.&rdquo;</p>

REPLY<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
MR. C. BRADLAUGH.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHRISTIANITY AND SCEPTICISM.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Tuesday evening, April 4th, Mr.
Bradlaugh delivered his second lecture on &ldquo;Christianity and
Scepticism,&rdquo; before a very crowded audience, in the Free
Library.&nbsp; He commenced by observing:</p>
<p>In continuing this course of lectures, I naturally follow the
same wording of the subjects as that taken by the Bishop of
Peterborough; and I may say that those who charge me with
misquoting the Bishop, will probably think differently when I say
that I have taken fair pains to be accurate in my
representation.&nbsp; I took careful and almost verbatim notes,
and I hold in my hand a transcript of the notes of an independent
shorthand writer, and where these have disagreed, which has been
very seldom, I have checked them by so much of the lecture as
appeared summarised in the <i>Daily Press</i>.&nbsp; It appeared
to me to be accurate, and I think there was no ground for saying
that I misrepresented the Bishop.&nbsp; You who think so, had
better leave that for him to say, if he thinks it
necessary.&nbsp; He took the instance of Thomas as that of a
representative Sceptic.&nbsp; He was good enough to tell us that
the unbelief of Thomas was not unreasonable, that, on the
contrary, it was reasonable and natural that he should feel some
doubt about the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I propose to
examine that position.&nbsp; Was it reasonable that Thomas should
doubt?&nbsp; Thomas was a disciple selected by Jesus.&nbsp; He
had been present at the whole of the miracles of Jesus.&nbsp; If
the Bishop&rsquo;s case be true, he had seen Jesus raise Lazarus
from the dead, he had heard Jesus say he came to die, and to rise
again; and I ask you, if it was reasonable for Thomas to doubt
after he had seen a hundred miracles performed, then how much
more reasonable for me to doubt?&nbsp; I have never seen any
miracles.&nbsp; But, said the Bishop, Thomas is a fair example of
the Sceptic, for Thomas said, I will not believe unless I see,
&amp;c.&nbsp; This, the Bishop said, is the very essence of
scepticism.&nbsp; Now I don&rsquo;t know where my Lord Bishop got
his notion of scepticism; I am sure that there is no writer on
the side of the party which permits me to speak <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>for it, who
defines scepticism in that manner.&nbsp; I have here the
explanation of Buckle, which I take as that of a man occupying a
position independent of the prejudices attaching to my extreme
heresy.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Scepticism, I merely mean hardness of
belief, so that an increased Scepticism is an increased
perception of the difficulty of proving assertions, or, in other
words, it is an increased application and an increased diffusion
of the laws of evidence.&nbsp; This feeling of hesitation and of
suspended judgment, has in every department of thought been the
invariable preliminary to all the intellectual revolutions
through which the human mind has passed, and without it there
could be no progress, no change, no civilisation.&nbsp; In
physics it is the necessary precursor of science, in politics of
liberty, in theology of toleration.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now I take leave
to say that there is no sceptical writer, neither Hobbes, nor
Hume, nor Locke, nor Berkeley, no sceptical writer either upon my
own side or upon the side of theology, unless you take the
ravings of some wretched madman, who defines Scepticism as my
Lord Bishop defined it.&nbsp; I say it was either a false
definition within the knowledge of the Bishop, or that Dr. Magee
was imperfectly acquainted with the views he proposed to
answer.&nbsp; The definition conveys a false notion of
Scepticism, which is really but a word for investigation.&nbsp;
The Bishop draws a distinction, and a correct distinction,
between knowledge and belief, and in that very distinction he
annihilated his own definition of Scepticism.&nbsp; He said, and
rightly, When once the senses have taken cognizance of any
phenomenon, that is no longer a matter of belief but a matter of
knowledge.&nbsp; If I sensate any condition of existence, I have
passed the stage of belief and arrived at the stage of
knowledge.&nbsp; I now come to a marvellous
position&mdash;marvellous as advanced by a bishop&mdash;viz.,
that religion or Christianity must be taken as incapable of
scientific demonstration; because, if that be true, what becomes
of the arguments of the Paleys, of the Pye Smiths, and of the
Gillespies?&nbsp; Are the volumes of proofs of the existence of
Deity all waste paper?&nbsp; What becomes of the huge mass yearly
issued from the press to prove the truth of Christianity?&nbsp; I
take it that in the opinion of the Bishop every one of these has
hitherto failed, for he says we cannot demonstrate the existence
of a Deity or the truth of the Christian religion so as to leave
no doubt.&nbsp; A demonstration so complete that it leaves no
doubt, is admitted to be impossible; that is an admission for
which I thank the Lord Bishop, because it is a <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>justification
to doubters.&nbsp; We have two admissions, one that the doubt of
Thomas is a reasonable doubt, and another, that Christianity
under no circumstances can be rendered free from doubt.&nbsp; I
will thank you to bear those two positions in mind.&nbsp; The
Bishop says we cannot demonstrate the existence of God, and I am
inclined to accept his position, but he gives reasons of the
strangest description to justify his conclusions.&nbsp; He says
we cannot prove the existence of God because he is
invisible.&nbsp; Does the Bishop mean that only the things
cognised by sight can be proved?&nbsp; Is it true that he
believes in an invisible God?&nbsp; What say the Thirty-nine
Articles of the Church?&nbsp; They say that Jesus, with body,
flesh, and bones, ascended to heaven.&nbsp; Were these
invisible?&nbsp; The Bishop believes what is pictured in the
Bible.&nbsp; Does the Bible teach an invisible God?&nbsp; We read
in the twenty-fourth chapter of Exodus, 9, 10, 11: &ldquo;Then
went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the
elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel; and there was
under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and
as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.&nbsp; And upon
the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand; also
they saw God, and did eat and drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; I want to know
if this God is an invisible God?&nbsp; I want to know whether the
Bishop is on this point an infidel, and whether he here
disbelieves the Bible?&nbsp; The Bible says that God is not
invisible.&nbsp; Which are we to believe?&mdash;the Bishop, the
Bible, or the Thirty-nine Articles?&nbsp; We are forbidden to
deny either the Bible or the Thirty-nine Articles under penalty
of prosecution.&nbsp; The Bishop said a Jew is not a sceptic, and
the reason given is certainly equally a marvellous one, for he
said the Jew believes in Moses, and therefore cannot believe in
Jesus.&nbsp; Is it logical that any body who believes in Moses
cannot believe in Jesus?&nbsp; Surely the Bishop contradicted
himself, for it is to Moses and the prophets he appeals.&nbsp; It
is not true, even from the Church of England stand-point, that a
man disbelieves in Jesus because he believes in Moses.&nbsp; It
is not true that if I believe in the authenticity of the
Pentateuch, it necessarily excludes my belief in the Gospel, and
yet this is the reasoning indulged in by the able and learned
confuter of modern infidelity.&nbsp; The Bishop said that the
Deist and the Pantheist are not sceptics, for they have a belief,
nor, he said, are even those sceptics who say there is no
God.&nbsp; I never read, except in tracts and sermons, and
religious essays, of any who say there is no <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>God.&nbsp;
Some persons talk about the fools who say there is no God, and
bishops preach against them, but an Atheist does not say there is
no God.&nbsp; The Atheist says the term &ldquo;God&rdquo; conveys
no idea to his mind.&nbsp; I have never yet heard a definition of
God from any living man, nor have I read a definition by dead or
living man that was not self-contradictory.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
deny the word &ldquo;God,&rdquo; because I don&rsquo;t know
anything about its meaning.&nbsp; Denial like affirmation must
refer to some proposition that is understood.&nbsp; But the
moment you tell me you mean the God of the Bible, or the God of
the Koran, or the God of any particular church, I am prepared to
tell you that I deny that God.&nbsp; So long as the term means
your absence of knowledge as to particular phenomena, and
represents the undiscovered, I am not &ldquo;fool&rdquo; enough
to say there is no God; and I say the Bishop should have known
that no modern Atheist ever propounded such a proposition to any
one.&nbsp; It is when you tell me of God distinct from the
universe, creating the universe different from himself, and
adding to his own existence, that I am compelled to deny that
God.&nbsp; The Bishop said the sceptic is not only one who
denies, but one who asks for evidence of an unreasonable
kind.&nbsp; Suppose myself; am I a sceptic as to the Bible,
according to the Bishop&rsquo;s notion?&nbsp; When I examine the
Bible, I find it is admitted that the common version is so bad
that a better is now in hand.&nbsp; I find when I refer to the
sources of this version there are only three sources&mdash;the
Hebrew, the Samaritan, and the Septuagint.&nbsp; When I examine
the Septuagint I find the Protestant writers such as Fulke and
Whittaker, writing against Bellarmine and others, declaring that
the Septuagint is corrupt from beginning to end.&nbsp; Dr. Irons
says no one knows where the so-called Septuagint version was
written, when it was written, nor by whom it was written, and it
is clearly the work of different generations.&nbsp; When I
examine the Greek of the Septuagint as against the Hebrew, I find
words and verses in the one that are not in the other.&nbsp; As a
sceptic is it unreasonable for me to ask the Bishop how he knows
that one is better than the other?&nbsp; When I go to the Hebrew
the difficulty is still greater.&nbsp; I say that not even the
Bishop knows enough of the Hebrew to guide us with reasonable
explanation.&nbsp; It is not enough to say that mere ignorant
infidels do not know it.&nbsp; I find Spinoza, writing 200 years
ago, declaring that Hebrew was a language utterly dead, that its
grammars and lexicons were lost, that time, <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the great
consumer, had blotted out the meaning of many words from the
memory of man.&nbsp; Suppose that I have recourse to those
professing some knowledge of Hebrew.&nbsp; Gesenius, Bellamy,
Parkhurst, Newman, Eichorn, Bresslau, Ginsburg, give me different
meanings for many of the same words on important points of
theology.&nbsp; How am I to be satisfied?&nbsp; What objections
will be reasonable?&nbsp; Suppose I try to be content with the
ordinary Hebrew version, what then?&nbsp; I find that it is a
version written with points, which points have not existed more
than 1250 or 1300 years; and the text itself is of two
characters.&nbsp; That which is written is not always read, and
that which is read is not written.&nbsp; I find a clergyman of
the Church like Dr. Irons admitting that the traditional reading
of the Hebrew text is often of more value than the text.&nbsp; I
find Christians saying this Hebrew is an ancient language, and
when I try to trace it I find that before 2500 years back there
is no trace of it at all.&nbsp; Moses could not have written in
the Hebrew we have, for what to-day we call the Hebrew did not
then exist.&nbsp; Who is to decide on this point as to the
reasonableness of my scepticism?&nbsp; Am I to decide or my Lord
Bishop?&nbsp; Let us consider this a little more.&nbsp; We have a
Samaritan, a Septuagint, and Hebrew Bible, but in the Samaritan
we have only the Pentateuch, and I find words and verses in the
Samaritan not in the Septuagint, and not in the Hebrew, and I
find words and verses in the Hebrew and Septuagint, which are not
in the Samaritan.&nbsp; Is it unreasonable for me to ask how so
many blunders have got into this book, if it contains a
revelation from God?&nbsp; Then I come to try to get a clue from
the Gospels, and I find again that no man knows when they were
written, where they were written, or by whom they were
written.&nbsp; Clergymen of the Church have invented arguments
from the first century fathers for the existence of the
Gospels.&nbsp; I used to believe that such testimony existed; I
could not suppose that writers like Dr. Paley had invented
testimony of the fathers, but when I went to the great libraries
to verify authorities, and I found that he manufactured evidence,
I ask, was I, as a sceptic, a reasonable man in challenging the
Church?&nbsp; The Bishop says a Sceptic is not to be attacked
because he doubts, but because of his reason for the doubt.&nbsp;
I doubt because I cannot help it.&nbsp; Is that a good reason or
not?&nbsp; Is the Church entitled to say &ldquo;It is not true,
you might believe if you like?&rdquo;&nbsp; And mark, the Bishop
had the audacity to declare <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>that Christianity is not intolerant
of the doubter, but of the spirit of doubt.&nbsp; The Church used
to burn the doubter, and then it burnt his books, and locked him
up in prison.&nbsp; It now gathers 3,000 people into the nave of
the Cathedral to hear the attack on the doubter, and refuses to
grant the use of any place for a reply.&nbsp; It is not
intolerant to the doubter, it is only intolerant of the spirit of
doubt!&nbsp; I learned from the Bishop that a man might be a
religious believer, and at the same time a sceptic, and in
explaining this he used language of an astounding
character.&nbsp; He said if a man were to say, <i>I</i> cannot
believe in the existence of God till I have it demonstrated to me
as clearly as that the three angles of a triangle are equal to
two right angles, then he is in principle a sceptic, because if
he had not that sort of proof, he would begin to doubt of the
existence of God; all this time his assent to the existence of
God would have rested on a sceptical foundation.&nbsp; This was
one of the most marvellous pieces of nonsense that any one could
talk.&nbsp; How can any one, while assenting to God&rsquo;s
existence, say, I cannot believe in God till it is proved to
demonstration?&nbsp; He makes the true believer commence by
saying he cannot believe in God till it is proved.&nbsp; If
anyone here had used that language, I should have said that he
did not understand what he was talking about; but when a Bishop,
a learned Bishop, the paragon of eloquence and logic, brought
here as more competent than your own Bishop, talks such nonsense,
how am I to reply?&nbsp; Let us take a startling contrast which
the Bishop thought right to give us.&nbsp; He contrasted Thomas
the doubter with Simon Peter the believer.&nbsp; I have read the
Bible a little, and I think that of all the cowardly rascals of
whom I ever read, the greatest rascal was Simon Peter.&nbsp; He
was called under great advantages; he had been out fishing, and
he caught nothing, and the Lord helped him to a good catch of
fish; Simon Peter&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother was cured of a
fever; Simon Peter was with Jesus when he fed the people with a
few loaves and fishes, and he took part in the collection of the
fragments.&nbsp; He was present at the transmigration.&nbsp; It
was to him that Jesus said, &ldquo;To thee I give the keys of the
kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Simon Peter was with the Lord all
through his life; and when Jesus came to trouble, he was the
first who abandoned him and denied him, even with oaths, &ldquo;I
know not the man;&rdquo; and that Peter is the model of faith
whom the Bishop presents to you.&nbsp; Of the two I rather prefer
Thomas to Peter.&nbsp; Certainly Peter came back to the <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Church when
he caught more fish.&nbsp; When Jesus rose from the dead, Peter
did not or would not know him, but when Jesus said &ldquo;Throw
in your net,&rdquo; and he did so, and caught more fish, then he
knew Jesus directly.&nbsp; I will ask what lesson the Lord Bishop
meant to convey by the contrast between those two?&nbsp; In what
sort of way is Peter put in contrast?&nbsp; Simon Peter was true
enough when any profit was to be got by it; he ran away when
danger came.&nbsp; This is the model which the Lord Bishop puts
before you to copy.&nbsp; But Dr. Magee said that Christianity
could not be demonstrated.&nbsp; Christian evidences were of some
use as weapons when believers were exposed to assaults on their
faith.&nbsp; If I thought he had intended to preach a comic
sermon instead of a serious one, I could have heartily laughed at
this.&nbsp; He says that the evidences of Christianity are
weapons to put in the hands of every man and woman when his or
her innermost soul is assailed by the enemy with desolating
doubt.&nbsp; Is it true that God permits an enemy to reduce man
to the level of the beast, and to be continually besieging the
soul of man?&nbsp; Is it true that the subtle devil tempts man
from the faith?&nbsp; If it be true, then the devil exists either
because God cannot help it, or will not prevent it; and if he
exists because God is powerless to prevent, then God is not
omnipotent; if God wills it, then God consents to&mdash;nay,
strives to procure man&rsquo;s damnation.&nbsp; But, says the
Bishop, Christianity does not repel the doubter, and he even
admits the utility of doubt, subject only to one condition.&nbsp;
Before I deal with the Bishop&rsquo;s condition, permit me to
quote what Buckle has said on the effect of doubt, and I quote
him because he stands in a position entitling him to the
attention of the extreme heterodox, as well as of the extreme
orthodox.&nbsp; He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Although the acquisition of fresh knowledge
is the necessary precursor of every step in social progress, such
acquisition must itself be preceded by a love of inquiry, and
therefore by a spirit of doubt, because without doubt there will
be no inquiry, and without inquiry there will be no knowledge,
for knowledge is not an inert and passive principle which comes
to us whether we will or no; but it must be sought before it can
be won; it is the product of great labour, and, therefore, of
great sacrifice.&nbsp; And it is absurd to suppose that men will
incur the labour and make the sacrifice for subjects respecting
which they are already perfectly content.&nbsp; They who do not
feel the darkness, will never look for the light.&nbsp; If on any
point we have attained to certainty, we make no <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>further
inquiry on that point, because inquiry would be useless or
perhaps dangerous.&nbsp; The doubt must intervene before the
investigation can begin.&nbsp; Here, then, we have the act of
doubting as the originator, or at all events the necessary
antecedent of all progress.&nbsp; Here we have that scepticism,
the very name of which is an abomination to the ignorant, because
it disturbs their lazy and complacent minds; because it troubles
their cherished superstitions; because it imposes on them the
fatigue of inquiry; and because it rouses even sluggish
understandings to ask if things are as they are commonly
supposed, and if all is really true which they from their
childhood have been taught to believe.&nbsp; The more we examine
this great principle of scepticism, the more distinctly shall we
see the immense part it has played in the progress of European
civilisation.&nbsp; To state in general terms, what in this
introduction will be fully proved, it may be said that to
scepticism we owe that spirit of inquiry which, during the last
two centuries, has gradually encroached on every possible
subject, has reformed every department of practical and
speculative knowledge; has weakened the authority of the
privileged classes, and thus placed liberty on a surer
foundation; has chastised the despotism of princes; has
restrained the arrogance of the nobles, and has even diminished
the prejudices of the clergy.&nbsp; In a word, it is this which
has remedied the three fundamental errors of the olden time,
errors which made the people in politics too confiding, in
science too credulous, in religion too intolerant.&nbsp; We have
thus seen the rise of that scepticism which in physics must
always be the beginning of science, and in religion must always
be the beginning of toleration.&nbsp; There is, indeed, no doubt
that in both cases individual thinkers may by a great effort of
original genius, emancipate themselves from the operation of this
law.&nbsp; But in the progress of nations no such emancipation is
possible.&nbsp; As long as men refer the movements of the comets
to the immediate finger of God, and as long as they believe that
an eclipse is one of the modes by which Deity expresses his
anger, they will never be guilty of the blasphemous presumption
of attempting to predict such supernatural appearances.&nbsp;
Before they could dare to investigate the causes of these
mysterious phenomena, it was necessary that they should suspect
that the phenomena themselves were capable of being explained by
the human mind.&nbsp; In the same way until men are content in
some degree to bring their religion before the bar of their own
reason, they never can understand <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>how it is that there should be a
diversity of creeds, or how any one can differ from themselves
without being guilty of the most enormous and unpardonable
crime.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chillingworth says, &ldquo;Reason gives us knowledge, while
faith only gives us belief, which is a part of knowledge, and is,
therefore, inferior to it.&nbsp; It is by reason, and not by
faith, that we must discriminate in religious matters, and it is
by reason alone that we can distinguish truth from
falsehood.&rdquo;&nbsp; He solemnly reminds his readers that in
religious matters no one ought to be expected to draw strong
conclusions from imperfect premises, or to credit improbable
statements upon scanty evidence; still less, he says, was it ever
intended that men should so prostitute their reason as to believe
with infallible faith that which they are unable to prove with
infallible arguments.&nbsp; The Bishop, agreeing in the utility
of doubt, which he expressed in language nearly as strong as that
of Buckle, says there is one condition without which doubt cannot
be useful, and this condition, being in truth an entire hindrance
to doubt, is utterly unreasonable and impossible.&nbsp; He says
the condition on which doubt can be accepted as useful is that it
starts on a certain basis of religious belief.&nbsp; Now a doubt
so based is only a fictitious doubt, a sham doubt, a hypocritical
pretence of doubt.&nbsp; When the Bishop said it was possible to
have a doubt based on belief in the proposition to be doubted, he
said what he could not defend on any platform where reply was
permitted.&nbsp; I feel that in talking of a man in his absence I
may be under the imputation of saying harsh things.&nbsp; The
manner in which this debate has gone on is not one of my
fashioning.&nbsp; The Church has taken the pains to give lectures
in the Cathedral where no reply could be offered; but I promise
you that I will endeavour to carry the war into Peterborough, and
see whether the Bishop will attempt an answer under the shadow of
his own cathedral.</p>
<p>I have now to complain of something still worse than that the
Bishop should have forgotten his Bible, entirely ignored the
Thirty-nine Articles, and occasionally in the hurry of rapid
speech contradicted his previous sentences.&nbsp; All these are
matters at which in even an extraordinary man burdened with a
bishop&rsquo;s dignity, we need not wonder at all; but when we
find him blundering in metaphysics, when we find him making
mistakes which a man versed in the merest student&rsquo;s
rudiments of Mill or the Scotch and German metaphysicians, would
not make, when we find the Bishop so blundering, either wilfully
or ignorantly, it puts me in a <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>position of extreme difficulty.&nbsp;
He distinguished between the Sceptic and the Christian, and said
the Christian had a faith in something underlying all
phenomena.&nbsp; The Christian&rsquo;s faith is nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; I will explain my position, and then that of the
Christian.&nbsp; The position of the Naturist is that there is
only one existence.&nbsp; I can only know that existence as
conditioned, as phenomenal.&nbsp; What we call
&ldquo;things&rdquo; are modes or conditions of existence, known
or distinguished from other conditions by various characteristics
or qualities; we only know substance or existence as
conditioned.&nbsp; We only know the phenomenal or the
conditioned.&nbsp; We affirm one existence, and that all we know
is condition of that one existence.&nbsp; But that is not the
Christian&rsquo;s position.&nbsp; The Christian says there are
two existences, the one what he calls the material universe, and
the other the Deity, distinct and differing in essence, who is
the creator of that universe out of nothing, and who can be the
destroyer of it.&nbsp; When the Bishop tried to make these two
opinions into one, he either did not know what he was talking
about, or he supposed that the people to whom he was talking had
not the time to study.&nbsp; The Bishop defined faith as trust or
assent, and he declared that not only in religion but in all
other matters we have faith.&nbsp; He said, for example, and his
illustration appeared to me most unfortunately chosen, that we
trusted in our wives, and children, and friends, that it was
possible that our wives might all the time be unfaithful, our
children unloving, and our friends treacherous.&nbsp; These are
not the words, but they give the exact sense of the words.&nbsp;
Now I will explain the difference between religious faith and the
ordinary faith.&nbsp; Our ordinary faith in one another in
every-day life is a confidence founded upon our own experience
and the experience of others; and it is because we find the
unfaithful wives are the fewest in number, and the treacherous
friends the fewest in number, that we trust in our wives and our
friends.&nbsp; But religious faith is something entirely
different, it is not only not founded on experience, but it
contradicts experience.&nbsp; Religious belief is the prostration
of the intellect; ordinary every-day trust is the result of the
exercise of the intellect.&nbsp; The Bishop spoke of
morality.&nbsp; He said morality was based upon faith, and he
asked, supposing you did not go to faith, where were you to get
your standard of morality?&nbsp; What is morality, the Bishop did
not tell you.&nbsp; With me that is moral which tends to the
greatest happiness of the greatest <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>number, which inflicts the least
injury on any.&nbsp; What is moral the Bible does not tell you,
the Thirty-nine Articles do not tell you, the Creeds do not tell
you, the Nicene Creed does not tell you, the Apostles&rsquo;
Creed does not tell you.&nbsp; They say that it is moral not to
steal, but you must not say this with the Bible in your hand,
where you find a thief protected and rewarded.&nbsp; And as to
adultery, David got to heaven though he committed adultery, and
planned the most treacherous murder of the dishonoured
husband.&nbsp; It is moral to speak the truth, but Jacob, who
lied, got to heaven, and was loved by God, while his brother was
hated, though he appears to have been the better man of the
two.&nbsp; What is the morality of the Athanasian Creed?&nbsp;
You are to believe in a Father, a Son, and a Holy Ghost, three
persons in one God, and if you do not believe in this, without
doubt you are to perish everlastingly.&nbsp; Is that your
morality?&nbsp; He that believes and is baptised, shall be
saved.&nbsp; Is faith in Christ morality?&nbsp; Here it is moral
to eat beefsteaks, but on the banks of the Ganges it is
immoral.&nbsp; Where will you get your guide to morality?&nbsp;
No one man, no one book, no one church, can give it you.&nbsp;
Your guide to morality can only be got by gathering from the
wisdom, and availing yourself of the experience of the greatest
minds of past ages and the present times, and thus you may learn
to be moral.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t speak to annihilate the
Bible.&nbsp; No man can annihilate a book.&nbsp; If Moses or
Isaiah wrote, no man can sweep their work away from the page of
history, but I say that no book should dominate the world.&nbsp;
I am a sceptic, for I deny the absolute authority of one book to
dominate all people.&nbsp; I find among the Brahmins, among the
Buddhists, among the Chinese and Japanese, phases of human truth
which in other lands are almost entirely forgotten, which your
Jew books do not contain.</p>
<p>If you want to know how I would make a code of morality, I
would make it as you would a bouquet of flowers: from one plot in
a garden you cull the rose, from another other flowers of sweet
perfume, from another the flowers of brilliant hue, until colour
blending with colour and fragrance aiding, your bouquet presents
beauty to the eye and sweet perfume to the scent; so I would take
from Shakspere the fruit of his wide grasping brains, from Swift
his brilliant wit, from Montesquieu his great power of
generalisation, from Voltaire his grand irony, from Rabelais his
biting thought, from Spinoza his grand logic, from John Locke his
wise reason, I would take <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>from Dr. Magee his eloquence, and
bring them and the thoughts of the world&rsquo;s poets and
philosophers together.&nbsp; I would make my bouquet of
thought.&nbsp; I say the Bible is not a book to cast away, but to
place on our shelves beside the Koran, the Vedas, and other
old-world books, to mark how the thought of the world has
grown.&nbsp; We know that religion has a hold upon the mass, but
I claim for scepticism a higher morality.&nbsp; The belief in
religion is the wearing the old clothes of a former age, the
swaddling clothes adopted in the childhood of humanity, but
scepticism is the bursting out from these old swaddling
clothes.&nbsp; It is the effort of buried brain to burst its
grave and stand out alive for human deliverance.</p>

DISCOURSE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHRISTIANITY AND FAITH.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Thursday evening, March 30th,
1871, the nave of the Cathedral, Norwich, was much crowded with
the citizens of all classes, to hear the third sermon of the
Bishop of Peterborough, on &ldquo;Christianity and
Faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before the sermon the Bishop prayed specially
for the conversion of the infidels present.&nbsp; He selected his
text from the Gospel according to St. John, xx. 29,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blessed are they that have not seen, and
yet have believed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His Lordship said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, I endeavoured to show you what
scepticism is, and what it leads to.&nbsp; We saw that scepticism
is not simply doubt, but that it is doubt of a particular
kind.&nbsp; It is that state of doubt which arises from insisting
on referring every question for solution to one part, and one
only, of our nature, to the sceptical understanding.&nbsp; It is
that state of doubt which arises from refusing to believe until
it has been made scientifically and mathematically impossible to
doubt.&nbsp; And we saw what this leads to; we saw that it
necessarily leads to the destruction of all belief properly
so-called, to the destruction of every kind of assent, except
assent to scientific and demonstrated facts; that it puts an end
to all belief which rests upon moral certainty, as distinguished
from scientific certainty, and therefore it puts an end to all
belief that appeals to any part of our nature except the
understanding; all belief with which the heart and spirit of man
have anything to do; all belief of the higher and nobler kind;
all belief that arises out of the higher and nobler part of our
nature; all belief that is in character and essence moral, and
all the higher and nobler life which arises out of such
belief.&nbsp; We saw that scepticism was essentially fatal to
morality; that there is no scientific demonstration of morality,
and that in order to be moral it is necessary to exercise an act
of faith; that morality cannot justify itself to the sceptical
understanding; as we saw that as religion is not capable of
scientific demonstration, as it does appeal to something else
than the logical faculty, as it does appeal to man&rsquo;s heart
and spirit, it cannot justify itself to the sceptical <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>intellect;
and that scepticism is necessarily as fatal to religion as it is
to morality, and to all belief except scientific belief.</p>
<p>I hope you saw what a waste of time it is to endeavour to
satisfy the consistent sceptic; we have absolutely nothing in
common.&nbsp; It is impossible that religion can silence
scepticism, unless it ceases to be religion.&nbsp; It is just as
absurd to object to religion that it is not science, as to object
to science that it is not religion.&nbsp; It is the wisest course
we can take in dealing with sceptics to begin, and for the most
part to end the discussion, by asking this plain question: You
tell us that you are sceptical, and you demand all your doubts to
be satisfied before you believe; we ask you, Do you believe in
anything, and if so, what do you believe in the proper sense of
the word?&nbsp; Do you assent to anything on trust?&nbsp; Do you
believe in anything you cannot demonstrate?&nbsp; If so, you have
no right to say to us that we should not believe a
religion.&nbsp; If you say, I believe in nothing but what can be
demonstrated, then we have nothing to answer, we must leave you
to be refuted by the common sense of mankind, and by every act of
your daily life which is based on trust.&nbsp; It would save a
vast deal of wasted time were we to take this course.&nbsp; Let
me advise all Christians; before you allow a sceptic to put you
to the proof, ask, What is it you believe?&nbsp; Do you believe
anything in the matter of religion? and if so, remember you
should not bring any objection against our faith which applies
equally to yours.&nbsp; We cannot allow of faith for all the
difficulties of your belief, while you ask demonstration for all
the difficulties of our belief.&nbsp; Faith for both, or faith
for neither; but not faith for one and demonstration for the
other.&nbsp; We seek not to get a logical victory over our
opponents; that is the poorest of all ambitions; but we recommend
such a course for this reason, that you may see that the very
same objections which are brought against our belief, lie against
any belief, and all belief, and so be strengthened in your faith;
for after all man must believe something.&nbsp; There is a
necessity of belief in the soul of man.&nbsp; We ask for the sake
of our opponents, if we throw them back upon considering the
basis of their own belief, and ask them if they are not
unconsciously to themselves in some degree believers while they
call themselves sceptics?</p>
<p>And now, while I have endeavoured thus clearly to show you
that religion, like morality, has no answer, properly speaking,
to scepticism&mdash;but that it rests upon an act of faith in
answer to what is ever saying, How, what, and why?&mdash;let us
come back <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>then to that point at which we left it last night.&nbsp;
That is the point at which we saw, that in order to be moral, and
to believe in morality, we must exercise an act of faith, we must
trust in ourselves, in our own higher and better nature.&nbsp; It
must be an act of faith which never can justify itself to the
understanding.&nbsp; Submit the understanding to the soul,
elevate the conscience above the merely logical and questioning
faculty; say by the exercise of a higher faculty, say by the
power of that instinct of faith, which is given us for the very
purpose that we may rise above the instinct of doubt&mdash;say, I
know that this is right and this is true, while I have a
soul.&nbsp; There is in the heart of every human being an eternal
opposition between the merely sceptical understanding and the
spiritual faculty, between that which demonstrates and that which
believes, between the mind which we share with the animal, and
the soul which we Christians believe we specially derive from
God; and these two are opposite the one to the other.&nbsp; That
in us which says, This must be so, this shall be so so, is a
higher faculty than that which in us inquires, Why is it so, how
can this be so?&nbsp; And that act of faith in us on which our
morality, our religion, and our higher forms of being rest, is
that by which we assert the supremacy of the one above the
other.&nbsp; We are not always conscious, nor often conscious, of
this contradiction in our innermost nature, of the opposition
between the spiritual part of our nature and the mere fleshly
man.&nbsp; There are times, however, when we feel conscious of
it.&nbsp; There are times when to each one of us comes some dire
and deadly temptation, when we find ourselves in the presence of
some coveted object, when the animal craves for its
gratification, and the spirit trembles at the thought of the
unlawful thing; and then we find the serpent intellect pleading
in an ingenious way that there is no law against it.&nbsp; I say,
there is not in this church a single man or woman who has not
felt the eternal opposition between the spirit and the flesh; who
has not felt that his deliverance from temptation, the mastery
over the evil thing that was leading him on to evil, lies not in
any logic or demonstration, but in the submission of the logical
faculty to the spiritual, in saying to the animal part of our
nature, Be silent, submit, I will be righteous, I will not
sin.&nbsp; I say, in that moment we do become conscious of the
opposition that exists between the intellectual and spiritual
part of our nature.&nbsp; It is then that the great billows of
our souls are ebbing and flowing in the agony of our <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>temptation.&nbsp; It is at that time we feel the
innermost parts of our being, the fountains of the great deep
broken up; and then the spirit says, I will be righteous.&nbsp;
And though we are not conscious of it, though the animal has been
accustomed to obey the man, there is this secret opposition
between the two.&nbsp; It is in the nature of what oculists tell
us.&nbsp; They tell us, that the image of an object is inverted
on the retina of the eye, and that it is only by constant habit
of correction of the impression that we see things truly.&nbsp;
So there is the natural inversion of the nature of the man; the
animal gets the upper hand in the man, and it is only by the
unconscious training of the man in Christian society that the
supremacy of the moral part of the man is strongly established;
and we are not conscious of the act of faith, but still that act
of faith underlies all morality, and it is true in morality as in
religion, &ldquo;The just shall live by faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is no righteous deed that any one of us has done that we did not
do by virtue of this act of faith; &ldquo;The just shall live by
faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now let us pass on to another question, for if the whole moral
and religious life is based upon the act of faith, there
doubtless must be a good reason for it.&nbsp; We Christians
believe that God made us so for a good reason.&nbsp; Can we see
any reason why we should live our moral life by faith?&nbsp; That
faith is not a mere assent to propositions, it is trust in a
person, in a nature, a belief that we are better, nobler, than
our understanding would persuade us we are.&nbsp; Every time this
opposition which I have described arises within a man, he is
given a choice; he has to pass through a probation, or a test as
to whether he will or will not believe in his better self,
whether he will rise up to the idea of his spiritual nature, or
sink down to the depths of his animal nature.&nbsp; There is a
trial for him, and a discipline in the trial, and a culture and a
growth of his moral nature if he stands firm in the trial.&nbsp;
We cannot believe, in such a moment of trial, in our nobler and
better selves, without becoming in the very act of believing,
nobler and better out of such strife; and the man comes out
stronger every time he wrestles with his baser self; his purer
and nobler self comes out of the trial nobler and purer.</p>
<p>There is a deep meaning in the temptation of our Saviour, when
he is said to have been with the wild beasts, in that hour when
the man is wrestling with the wild beasts, or the brute part of
his nature, and his spiritual nature comes strong out of the
struggle; just as the waving of the <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>branches of the trees in the wind,
makes the sap circulate to the tiniest leaflet, and brings the
life-blood of the plant to every part.&nbsp; This is the use and
object of the act of faith; to train, discipline, and elevate the
man.&nbsp; Further, I have said, in every case in which a man
believes in his better self, he becomes better; but we have to
deal not only with our better selves, we have to come constantly
in contact with other natures and other personalities than our
own.&nbsp; Now, what happens when we encounter a higher or more
moral nature than our own?&nbsp; Just the very same trial and
discipline; because if a man comes to deal with a higher and
better nature than his own, there is always a trial to the lower
nature.&nbsp; If a higher nature could be easily understood by a
lower nature, then the two natures would be equal.&nbsp; It is
the very essence of a higher and purer nature to be something of
a mystery to a lower nature.&nbsp; Some of the sayings or the
doings of that higher nature, will always appear strange and
puzzling to the lower nature, just because it is a lower
nature.&nbsp; There is always the possibility of the lower nature
saying of the higher nature, This nature is no better than mine,
I do not believe in its higher or greater goodness.&nbsp; But are
these cynical, worldly-wise men who disparage others, generally
speaking, the most improving and valuable of our
acquaintances?&nbsp; Do we not generally find these cynical,
bitter, disparaging men to be men of low tone?&nbsp; They have
lowered their moral nature in the hour of probation and trial;
they have sunk lower than themselves, because they have refused
to believe in something higher and better than themselves.&nbsp;
If these men could have risen to the higher natures they had to
deal with, then in that very hour, their own nature would have
grown purer, nobler, and higher.&nbsp; So we see again, the act
of faith would be an act of probation, an act of discipline, an
act of moral culture and growth.&nbsp; Therefore we say it is
true, &ldquo;Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now let us go one step further.&nbsp; We have seen that in
all morality there is an act of faith, and we believe in our own
higher nature and the higher nature of others, and in so doing we
ourselves grow better; but is there not something better
still?&nbsp; We that believe in higher natures than our own, is
there not in our hearts an instinctive belief that there must be
somewhere perfect righteousness, perfect truth, perfect
holiness?&nbsp; We seek for it, believe in it; do we ever find
it?&nbsp; The more we know of men, though we may <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>know more of
their excellencies, we are compelled to know something more too
of their imperfections.&nbsp; The result of this discovery is
that one of two things happens, according as we listen to our
understanding or our will.&nbsp; The sceptical understanding
says, There is no such thing as perfection anywhere.&nbsp; That
answer is unanswerable if we look only to experience.&nbsp; Is
that the answer of the soul and heart of man?&nbsp; No, the soul
and the heart rebel against this cheerless teaching.&nbsp; The
soul has ever been uttering its protest against this despairing
creed, ever speaking its belief in the reality of a perfect
righteousness, a perfect truth, a perfect holiness; but can never
attain to it.&nbsp; It may be a dream, but it is a dream that has
haunted humanity from the first hour of its existence.&nbsp; We
thus have faith in humanity, and the value of this faith is that
it elevates the soul which believes in it; a faith which cannot
justify itself to the understanding, a faith as deep as the human
heart, and as old as the hills.</p>
<p>There is in very deed, in a very true sense, although it may
be a low sense comparatively, a religion of humanity; a creed and
an act of faith; and that religion has for its creed these
articles: man is pure; he is not a bundle of passions merely; man
is responsible, he has to answer for his beliefs; man may yet be
perfect.&nbsp; There is no article in this creed that can be
justified to the sceptical intellect, and yet there is not a
single article in it that the loving heart of man, and that his
soul in his highest and best moments, does not cling to as the
very life of its life.&nbsp; The heart of man believes in the
perfectibility of humanity, in spite of sin and misery and
oppression.&nbsp; The long litany of man&rsquo;s [imperfections?]
comes down with a wail of despairing denial of the possibility of
perfection.&nbsp; Remedy after remedy has been tried, scheme
after scheme has been invented, and have been borne away like the
bubbles on the wave; but still the heart of man clings to the
belief that there is a perfect goodness somewhere, even when
civilisation fails to produce it, even in spite of what we have
seen in the last three months when the most civilised nations of
Europe have banded themselves together for mutual destruction; in
spite of all this disproof of perfection, the heart of man clings
to it still.&nbsp; We do have faith in humanity, and the value of
the faith is that it elevates the soul which believes in
it.&nbsp; This belief in the possibility of perfection, in the
possibility of delivering men from sin and sorrow, this is not
merely the dream of the poet, it is not merely the Utopia of the
philosopher, but it <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>is the instinctive might in the heart of the earnest
worker, that gives strength to him who does his duty amid the
haunts of sin and sorrow; it is this that sends the Christian
worker into the back streets and lanes of our great cities; it is
this that sends the Christian minister to the bedside of the
dying; it is this that makes men toil and suffer for their fellow
men, like him whom we worship, who saw in his dying hour of the
travail of his soul and was satisfied.</p>
<p>And now we take one step further.&nbsp; We have seen that
there is a faith which underlies all morality as well as
religion, and that this faith is the discipline of the soul, and
without it the soul cannot grow in morality or religion.&nbsp;
Let us suppose, for argument&rsquo;s sake, let us suppose that
for this yearning of the soul after an infinite perfection, there
is a corresponding reality&mdash;an absolutely perfect, a
supremely righteous and true and holy Being.&nbsp; And let us
suppose that it pleased him to make a revelation of himself to
man; what should we expect beforehand respecting that
revelation?&nbsp; Should we not expect that it would follow the
analogy of all other revelations to the higher and better part of
man&rsquo;s nature, and that inasmuch as morality needs faith, so
this manifestation of the Perfect One would come in some way or
other so as to call out the act of faith?&nbsp; Should we not
expect that if this were the only absolutely perfect nature, it
would appear to our lower and inferior nature in some respects
unintelligible, in some respects mysterious, in some respects
contradictory?&nbsp; For all mysteries, everything we cannot
understand, must come to our understanding in the shape of
contradictory propositions.&nbsp; We must expect that this higher
nature, this perfect nature, should try our faith.&nbsp; If it
would be unreasonable to suppose that an inferior man to himself
should understand a man, so also it would be unreasonable to
suppose that our nature should not find some difficulty in
perfectly appreciating and understanding the absolutely perfect
nature of a supremely perfect Being.&nbsp; Should we not expect
from analogy that we should have some more difficulty in
understanding God, than we have in understanding man?&nbsp; We
must expect the same trial of our faith, the same probation and
discipline of our spiritual nature, when it is brought into
contemplation of this perfect nature.&nbsp; Surely we should
beforehand expect that this would be the case; surely we might
say that the God who was perfectly understood could not be the
true God.&nbsp; When a man says, I want a God that is not a
mystery; I ask, Do you <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>know a man who is without a
mystery?&nbsp; Are you not a mystery yourself?&nbsp; Is there one
fellow being whom you understand?&nbsp; And yet you say, I have
not faith in a God whom I cannot understand.&nbsp; Who can
comprehend him who dwells in ineffable light, in whom there is no
variableness nor shadow of turning?&nbsp; If there be revelation
from God at all, it must try the faith of man.&nbsp; In the next
place, we should expect that it would be a revelation of a
righteous person; because we know that the highest tendencies of
our nature at their best moments are ever to find a righteous
person, and our faith that has been cultivated in our brother man
naturally looks for a person.&nbsp; Faith has ever been trusting
in a person, in a nature, and therefore we should expect
beforehand that if there came a revelation of this God, it would
not come in the shape of a revelation of doctrines or creeds, but
that it would be a revelation of a person.&nbsp; We Christians
say there is made to us a revelation of the working of the Divine
Will, and the purpose of the Divine Designer, in the works of his
hands.&nbsp; We say the invisible things of God are revealed by
the things that are made.&nbsp; There is that in the world which
testifies to a creator and designer.&nbsp; This we believe
because there is that in us which instinctively, when it finds a
work of art, supposes an artist; and finding a work requiring
design, has belief in a designer.&nbsp; We say, &ldquo;The
heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows his
handy work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this revelation must follow the law of all other
manifestations.&nbsp; There must be a possibility of denying it;
a discipline here, as in the other case, in which faith is called
into play; and therefore, though the world reveals its maker, it
does not demonstrate its maker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Day unto day is
uttering speech, and night unto night showeth forth
knowledge;&rdquo; but the speech is like the speech for things
spiritual, the utterance is for all who choose to believe
it.&nbsp; If men will, they may put it aside; and some deny it in
the face of the world.&nbsp; God has willed that there shall be
nothing in this world to demonstrate his existence; but it is now
as of old, inasmuch as men did not choose to retain God in their
knowledge, he gave them over to a reprobate mind.&nbsp; There is
a possibility, there is a necessity, in the manifestation of God,
that it should try the faith of man.&nbsp; Once more, we
Christians believe not only that God has revealed himself in his
works, but also in his word, in his Incarnate Word; that, in
answer to the craving desire of the soul of man to look upon
human <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>perfection, this earth has once been walked upon by a
perfect man; that in the story of the Gospels we possess that
which no imperfect souls could ever have imagined, the lineaments
of a perfect being.&nbsp; I am not saying that it is so, but it
is our belief.&nbsp; But before we opened the Gospels, we should
expect according to the analogy of all other holy and righteous
lives that we know of, that it should not demonstrate itself,
should not make itself an impossibility to the sceptical mind to
find fault with it, and should reveal itself to those whose lives
were like it, so that wisdom should justify herself by her
children.&nbsp; We should not expect, judging from analogy of
what we see in the world, that this life should in all respects
silence all opposition, and be understood by every mind that it
came in contact with.&nbsp; We should expect to hear that he was
despised and rejected of men, and some people besought him to
depart from their coasts.&nbsp; If the revelation of a divine and
perfect nature is to follow the analogy of all revelations of a
lower degree of perfection, and all manifestations of inferior
natures, then we must expect the same law will govern this case
as all others; there will be a possibility of doubt, and a trial
of faith, and to those who conquer the doubt and exercise the
faith, will the promise be realised, &ldquo;Blessed are they that
have not seen, and yet have believed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, it was not
with faith in a series of propositions only, nor in a set of
dogmas&mdash;though we believe the propositions and hold the
dogmas, but in the light of faith in this person&mdash;that the
disciples of the Perfect One went out to convert the world.&nbsp;
They did not preach Christ&rsquo;s teaching, but Christ.</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to you to read the Acts of the Apostles? if
so, you will have seen how little of the words of Christ, how
little of the teachings of Christ, appears there.&nbsp; When we
read in the Acts, how the Apostles went out to preach Christ, do
we read that they gathered the multitude in the forum?&nbsp; Did
they say, Listen to the morality of the Gospels?&nbsp; You will
not find a quotation from the Sermon on the Mount.&nbsp; What did
they do?&nbsp; They gathered the multitude together, and preached
not the words of Christ, but Christ.&nbsp; They said, Come and
believe in this man; it was the personality, it was the life and
death, and resurrection and ascension of him, that they
preached.&nbsp; It was a person in whom they asked the people to
believe; and the result is this extraordinary and singular fact,
that Christ is the only teacher among men whose life is greater
than his teaching.&nbsp; All other teachers <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>have faded
into insignificance in comparison with their teaching.&nbsp; Who
cares about the life of Euclid? but everybody believes in his
teaching.&nbsp; Men are fond of comparing Christ with
Socrates.&nbsp; Let us take it so.&nbsp; Did any man ever hear a
person say, I am dead with Socrates; I am buried with Socrates;
the life that I live is by faith in Socrates?&nbsp; Were such
words ever heard of any heathen teacher?&nbsp; How comes it that
men said this of Christ?&nbsp; The faith of the soul went out to
the nature and work of Christ.&nbsp; The faith of man triumphed
in the discovery of the perfect man.</p>
<p>Now we have reached the last point to which I have desired to
bring you in this series of sermons.&nbsp; We have reached the
historical fact, as to which others will follow me who will take
up the subject, and who will show the evidence arising from
history and prophecy.&nbsp; My task ends in removing the
stumbling-blocks which would prevent your coming to hear
them.&nbsp; It has been my part to lead you to the steps, to the
threshold of the temple.&nbsp; We have found difficulties that
have kept many away from the entrance to the temple.&nbsp; The
first is the belief that Christianity is opposed to
Freethought.&nbsp; And I have endeavoured to show you that
Christianity does not deny it, but asserts it; that where
Christianity does deny it, law and society deny it.&nbsp; The
second difficulty is that of scepticism.&nbsp; We have seen that
it is fatal to morality, and to all the higher forms of human
life, and that the sceptical understanding should submit to the
soul.&nbsp; Christianity only requires what morality has
done.&nbsp; I have answered the objection that Christianity must
appeal to faith, and must do so because it cannot find
demonstration.&nbsp; Our answer is that it has all the
demonstration that is possible for the supernatural or for
history.&nbsp; Christianity does make demands on faith, but it
acts in accordance with the analogy of human life; and
Christianity in claiming faith justifies its claim to be a
religion.</p>
<p>Now the time comes to close this discourse, in which from my
inmost soul I have set the truth before you.&nbsp; I will ask you
in all sincerity, Why do you suppose I am here?&nbsp; Some may
say because we are priests and bigots.&nbsp; To me, if I must put
it so, it makes no difference whether I come here or not.&nbsp;
Why do I come here?&nbsp; Do you really, honestly believe, that I
have come here to deceive you?&nbsp; Will you not give me credit,
that to the best of my ability and in all earnestness and
honesty, I have endeavoured to put before you the reasons that
seem to me sufficient for my belief?&nbsp; Hear us, then, <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>for this
reason if for no other, that we desire your souls for our Lord
and Master, that it is in his name we come among you, and because
we believe that Jesus is the Son of God and came down from heaven
to save men.&nbsp; It is for this reason, and this only, that we
are here to speak to you, that we may with the help of God deepen
your faith or shake your unbelief.&nbsp; We come with his word,
that calls on you to follow the higher and not the lower part of
your nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
ye shall be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are some who don&rsquo;t
believe in the first part of this message, there are few who do
not believe that men need to be saved, saved in this world, and
saved in the next, saved from some of the sin and misery in this
world.&nbsp; I ask, is there no need of faith, is there no desire
for the objects of faith?&nbsp; Among men have we not some need
of faith?&nbsp; The world is growing old and sick at heart.&nbsp;
All the remedies that have been tried for the evils of society,
have been tried in vain.&nbsp; Idol after idol has been set up,
has been rocked on its basis, and shivered.&nbsp; The gods of
mankind have been taken away, and the cry of despondency has been
raised, We have no humanity.&nbsp; Is there any evidence that
there shall be a perfection of humanity?&nbsp; Is it from faith
in men of science?&nbsp; Did science ever comfort the afflicted,
or allay human sorrows?&nbsp; Faith in civilisation?&nbsp; Can it
remedy the evils that are conquering society?&nbsp; Civilisation
now means the gathering of men in great masses, to live the
luxurious, the voluptuous life of great towns; it means the
weary, toilful, haggard life of others in these same towns; it
means the rich growing richer, and the poor growing poorer every
day.&nbsp; Civilisation throws its dark shadows in its
track.&nbsp; Civilisation and science, have they arrested war, or
softened the heart of humanity, or prevented strife between
nations?&nbsp; Civilisation, science and art have invented
mitrailleuses, and invented destructive methods of wholesale
murder.&nbsp; Where will you find in all these things a
substitute for faith?&nbsp; Some speak of the millennium, and of
the natural state of man being remedied in this world.&nbsp; We
believe in the final perfection of man, but not in this
world.&nbsp; We believe in the reign of righteousness, but it is
in the eternal world.&nbsp; It is in that faith that we gain
courage to look on the scenes and sorrows that afflict
humanity.&nbsp; It is in the strength of that faith that we look
down on the graves of the departed, and believe all is not dust
of the earth; but we take up the song of Christian triumph over
death, and thank God for the message &ldquo;Blessed are they that
have not seen and yet have believed.&rdquo;</p>

REPLY<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
MR. C. BRADLAUGH.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHRISTIANITY AND FAITH.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Wednesday evening, April 5th,
Mr. Bradlaugh delivered his third lecture on &ldquo;Christianity
and Faith,&rdquo; before an audience which crowded every corner
of the Free Library, Norwich.&nbsp; He said: In delivering the
last of this course of lectures, permit me to commence by
expressing my regret, that those who differ from me consider it
necessary to show their disagreement in the manner in which it
was expressed last night, on my leaving this room.&nbsp; If it
had been the conduct of some ignorant young persons only, I
should not have deemed it right to waste one moment in bringing
the matter before you, but there were full-grown and decently
dressed persons, who were distributing religious tracts, who
encouraged others in following me, and using foul language.&nbsp;
I could not help feeling how strong was the cause which I
advocate, and how wretchedly weak the cause of my opponents, when
such weapons were resorted to in lieu of fair reply.</p>
<p>I now address myself to the last sermon of the Bishop of
Peterborough, entitled &ldquo;Christianity and
Faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first portion of this was a
recapitulation of the principal arguments of the two previous
sermons, and then he made a statement utterly opposed to the
whole purpose of his sermons.&nbsp; I will deal with the exact
purport, if I do not read to you the precise words he
uttered.&nbsp; He said, It is a waste of time to endeavour to
satisfy the consistent sceptic.&nbsp; He said, We Christians,
have absolutely nothing in common with the consistent
sceptic.&nbsp; If that be true, why did the Bishop come to preach
the course of sermons to win back sceptics to the Church?&nbsp;
Why did the Dean and Chapter inaugurate the course of sermons, if
it was, in their opinion, impossible to satisfy the
sceptic?&nbsp; Why did the Bishop say it was not only to
strengthen the faith of those in the church, but to win back
those who had left it?&nbsp; If it be not possible to win them
back, then the whole course of sermons was a mere pretence, and I
put it that the Bishop was, either consciously or unconsciously,
misleading his hearers as to his <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>real views, or that he did not know
what he was talking about.&nbsp; The Bishop offered some advice
to Christians for dealing with sceptics.&nbsp; He said, Before
you allow a sceptic to put your belief to the proof, ask him what
is it that he believes.&nbsp; That is what you have no right to
do.&nbsp; The sceptic does not come to you at all to force his
opinions on you.&nbsp; You come to him when he is in the cradle,
and by aid of early habit and repetition of phrases in lieu of
thoughts, you put your religion into him, you train him to accept
your religion in school, you fashion his brain-power before it
has stability for resistance.&nbsp; He has a right to express his
disbelief in your religion, and you have no right to pretend to
answer him with a mere What do you believe?&nbsp; There is no
equality in the two positions; religion is law-protected,
scepticism is law-condemned; and the Bishop has no right to take
such ground: a sceptic&rsquo;s ignorance would be no evidence of
a believer&rsquo;s knowledge.&nbsp; But give the Bishop the full
benefit of the ground, and what does it amount to except that,
after the Dean and Chapter had made a parade of their desire to
answer infidelity, declaring that they would have the most
competent man, this most competent man is obliged to say, The
only way I advise you to meet modern infidelity is by admitting
in effect, that you can do no more for your faith than to ask the
infidel, What do you believe?&nbsp; I dismiss this; it is of so
trifling a character that if it had not formed a prominent part
of the Bishop&rsquo;s sermon, it would not have been worth
noticing.&nbsp; The Bishop, in dealing with Christianity and
Faith, said that morality is built on faith, and that in order to
be moral and have a code of morality, we must exercise an act of
faith, and believe in our higher and better nature.&nbsp; What is
our better nature, judging by the Churchman&rsquo;s
standard?&nbsp; The Articles of the Church of England declare
that our nature is always lusting to do evil.&nbsp; The Litany
says that each man is always trying to do wickedly, and entreats
the Lord to deliver us from the lusts of the flesh.&nbsp; How
then can we be asked to trust in a higher or better nature, which
the Church declares is a nature fallen, depraved, and constantly
tending to evil?&nbsp; The doctrine of the Bible is that there is
none who does good, that man&rsquo;s thoughts are evil
continually.&nbsp; It is sufficient for me to quote the Litany in
which the Bishop took part before his sermon, which said that we
are all miserable sinners, and prayed God to be merciful to
us.&nbsp; How can we rise to our higher and better nature, if the
existence of that <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>higher and better nature be authoritatively
denied?&nbsp; The Bishop says there is an eternal opposition in
our nature, between what he calls the sceptical understanding and
the spiritual faculty, between the mind which we share with the
animal and &ldquo;the soul, which we Christians believe we
specially derive from God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us clear away a little difficulty here.&nbsp; By mind I
mean the totality of cerebral ability and its results in
activity, and I deny that we share mind with any other animal at
all.&nbsp; Each animal has the mind special and peculiar to its
own organisation; and diverse races of men have diverse
characters and degrees of mind, limited by, and resulting from,
their organisation and its development.&nbsp; But it is the
Bible, and not the sceptic, that says the mind of man and the
minds of all other animals are on a level.&nbsp; The Bishop says
that the sceptic would degrade man to the level of the
beast.&nbsp; You have only to take the Bible and you will
read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I said in my heart concerning the estate of
the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they
might see that they themselves are beasts.&nbsp; For that which
befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing
befalleth them . . . so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a
beast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the doctrine is degrading, it is the Bible that teaches the
doctrine, and not the sceptic.&nbsp; Freethinkers never contend
for anything of the kind.&nbsp; On the contrary, we say that the
superiority of the intellect is distinctly marked in its
development, that not only are men mentally superior to all other
animals, but that some races of men are vastly superior to
others.&nbsp; What does the Bishop mean by opposition between
mind and soul?&nbsp; He did not trouble to give any evidence of
the existence of what he calls soul as apart from mind.&nbsp; I
challenge any one who may follow me to give me any evidence of
any sort of existence apart from mind, that we can call
soul.&nbsp; The Bishop said that there is a constant opposition
between the intellectual faculty, the mind which we share in
common with the beast, and the spiritual soul.&nbsp; I deny that
the Bishop advanced the slightest proof of&mdash;or gave any clue
to&mdash;any such soul.&nbsp; I deny that it is possible for any
man to conceive the existence of two separate existences in man:
one, mind; the other, soul.&nbsp; As to the opposition between
them, the Bishop says that God created man&rsquo;s intellectual
faculties, and that he also endowed man with a soul; and that the
soul is hostile to the mind; and that the mind is low and
grovelling, always in hostility to the soul.&nbsp; He thus makes
God put into man a degrading <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>nature, always hostile to religion,
and in a constant struggle with the soul.&nbsp; No more degrading
supposition can be made respecting God, who is thus pictured as a
malicious fiend; and if the Bishop had intended to make infidels,
he could not have contrived more effectual means than the
preaching this doctrine.</p>
<p>The Bishop, after dealing with the manner in which the
spiritual part of our nature overcomes what he calls the animal,
the intellectual or mental part of our nature&mdash;for he used
all these words to describe the natural man at war with the
spiritual man&mdash;says that the manner in which the spiritual
conquers the other, is only by the unconscious training of the
man in Christian society.&nbsp; The Bishop says that God has made
many millions of men, and given them minds in opposition to their
souls, that these minds are strong enough to lead men to evil,
and they cannot be brought to God, unless in Christian society;
so that the Buddhists, the Brahmins, the Mohammedans, and men of
all other persuasions must necessarily be damned, because, having
no Christian society, there is not amongst them the means of
overcoming this natural mind.&nbsp; This is a pretty specimen of
Christian teaching.&nbsp; But the Bishop is not even content with
this.&nbsp; Having told us that Christianity is founded on an act
of faith, and that faith is trust, he tells us that he believes
that we are better, nobler, than our understanding would persuade
us we are.&nbsp; Having told us that we have a wicked nature, a
depraved mind in conflict with the spirit, he says that our
morality is also to be founded on an act of faith, that we are
really better and nobler that we suppose.&nbsp; Where do we find
the evidence to justify this act of faith?&nbsp; We are,
according to the Bishop and his Church, all miserable sinners,
nor can we do good without the help of God.&nbsp; There is that
subtle serpent the devil constantly working in us, and our nature
is in league against God.&nbsp; The Bishop says the only way to
overcome this horrid nature is by the training of man in
Christian society, and yet two minutes after, he tries to
persuade us that we are better, nobler than he and his church say
we are.&nbsp; He says, in fact, we are all very wicked.&nbsp;
Adam ate an apple 6,000 years ago, and we are, in consequence,
all degraded and depraved; yet we are really nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; The Bishop stated that the effect of belief in our
nobler, better nature is the improvement of our character, and it
is by believing in what is better and nobler, and in the
possibility of being better and nobler, that we grow
better.&nbsp; <i>Ergo</i>, so long as men believe they are <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>born in a
state of natural depravity, and that of themselves they cannot do
good, so long as the mass of men believe that those are depraved
to damnation who cannot get trained in Christian society, so long
as they believe that millions of men will be lost because they
live without even hearing of Christ at all, so long they must be
degraded by that belief.&nbsp; They must believe that God made
the majority of mankind for damnation and the minority for
salvation; their faith must make themselves into the incarnations
of vileness and God into an almighty fiend.</p>
<p>The Bishop, not content with such subtle logic, goes on to
illustrations drawn from the Bible, and speaks of the temptation
of Jesus in the wilderness.&nbsp; He said there is a moral to be
drawn from this temptation story, because Jesus is said to have
been with the wild beasts, and there was a deep meaning in this
saying.&nbsp; I do read the Gospels sometimes, and therefore
puzzled myself about these wild beasts, not having read much of
them.&nbsp; I remembered the Jesus-God being taken up a high
mountain and shown all the kingdoms of the earth, as a possible
bribe if he would worship his own creature the devil.&nbsp; I
remembered his being taken up to a pinnacle of the temple and
invited to cast himself down; but I did not remember, nor do I
now remember, anything about wild beasts, save a few words in the
Gospel of Mark, and it is not even there shown that these wild
beasts had anything to do with the Lord&rsquo;s temptation.&nbsp;
Whether the Bishop has a special version of his own I do not
know.</p>
<p>Another point of the Bishop was, that when lower natures have
to contemplate higher natures, there is some mystery or
contradiction to the lower natures.&nbsp; The man who tries to
predetermine your decision on an alleged matter of fact, by
declaring that it is too mysterious for you to understand, and
that being mysterious, you must accept it as he explains it, is a
juggler with his intellect, and takes a position to which he has
no right.&nbsp; The Bishop was good enough to talk of our
degrading creed.&nbsp; Let him talk of his own degrading
creed.&nbsp; Our creed has not invented a bottomless pit filled
to its brink with brimstone for everlasting torture, nor has it
manufactured a devil more mighty than God to destroy God&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; Our degrading creed, at any rate, does not despair of
human kind, nor tell us that we should be poor here in order to
be rich hereafter, and be miserable here that we may be happy bye
and bye, when the life-ability for happiness is entirely
gone.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t despair of human kind, we assert the
improvability of the human race <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and we say if we make this life as
good as we can, we shall not be affrighted from our task by any
declaration that we may be unhappy hereafter.</p>
<p>But the Bishop went further, and carrying the war into our
camp, he declared that it was in consequence of faith in Christ
that men did Christian work, and he spoke of men doing good work
among the sick, and poor, and ignorant, and wretched, day by day
because they were Christians.&nbsp; Does he mean to say that
Mohammedans, and Buddhists, and Brahmins have amongst them no
kindly work for one another?&nbsp; Does he mean to say that men
cannot be human unless they have the special Christian&rsquo;s
creed?&nbsp; But this Christian work has been going on for 1800
years, so at least the Bishop says.&nbsp; Let us turn the pages
of its history over and read what it has really done.&nbsp; When
Christianity was cradled in the world, Italy and Greece had their
poets, painters, sculptors, men of literary fame, orators,
comedians, and tragedians.&nbsp; Wait for a century or two till
your much-vaunted Christianity has, by the aid of forgery, fraud,
and manufactured miracle, acquired some force.&nbsp; Wait till
the priests, crushing out all other learning, have become the
sole literary power in Europe.&nbsp; Did they teach the
people?&nbsp; No, they kept the people ignorant.&nbsp; (A voice,
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;)&nbsp; If any one says no, I will show century
after century what Christianity has been.&nbsp; Your first
century I will not trouble with until you show me its actual
pages; your second and third centuries are crowded with the
fabrication of forged evidences, the canonisation of pretended
saints; your fourth century shows the same work, and marks also
the quarrels commencing amongst yourselves for the spoils now
large enough to excite good Christians against each other; in the
fifth century Salvian one of your own presbyters, said the
Christian Church had become such a sink of vice, that it was a
species of sanctity for any one to be a little less vicious than
the others.&nbsp; He says of his fellow Christians that they lie
and cheat, are adulterers and murderers; that it is easier to
find a Christian guilty of all these crimes than one guilty of
none.&nbsp; Take the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth
centuries of Christianity, when infidelity was almost powerless,
before Voltaire lived, before Spinosa wrote, before Bruno trod
Europe round, and you have in these centuries, when Christianity
was the most powerful, the dark ages of this European world, when
all literature was stopped, all philosophy was hindered, all
science manacled by the Church.&nbsp; What was the Christian work
in the eleventh, twelfth, and <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>thirteenth centuries, when Christians
marched to the Holy Land?&nbsp; Let the plundered and miserable
countries tell; let burned villages and ravished women show the
way in which the soldiers of the Cross manifested their religion
even to their fellow Christians.&nbsp; Let these pages of blood
and rapine be read for Christian work.&nbsp; Where then was
liberty or popular rights?&nbsp; When the king, the barons, and
the priests were in power, did Christianity help the people to
get liberty?&nbsp; It is only within the last 300 years, since
the rise of heresy in Europe, that the people have gained any
freedom.&nbsp; The Church of England may say, This is not our
work; but it is a branch of the Church of Rome, and ought not to
repudiate the trunk it grew from.&nbsp; Nay, it has not even the
same right to plead to us as the Church of Rome.&nbsp; The Church
of Rome is consistent, and says to its followers, You on religion
are unable to think, we will and we do think for you.&nbsp; The
Church of England says, You have a right to think for yourselves,
but damns you if you think differently from the Church.&nbsp; You
say that hospitals are the fruits of Christianity.&nbsp; Where,
save in the monasteries, were the hospitals for 1500 years?&nbsp;
You boast of schools.&nbsp; Where were these at all for 1500
years?&nbsp; There were even in this country none worthy of the
name for little children till Robert Owen set his example at New
Lanark.&nbsp; You talk of going into the back streets, but is it
not true that squalor, misery, and vice, crowd the back streets
because the Bishops and the English Church have taken so much
from the people, and have so hindered the populace from
self-improvement, that they have only back streets themselves to
live in, while they build palaces for the king, and magnificent
structures for the Church?&nbsp; I attack the Church of England
because the Church has challenged me.&nbsp; I attack it as a
leech that for centuries has sucked the life-blood out of the
people, and which, with the power to aid and help civilisation,
has done nothing but retard it.</p>
<p>The Bishop said, Let us suppose the existence of a supremely
righteous, true, and holy being; let us suppose a revelation from
such a being; what do you suppose such a revelation should be
like? and he urged that the Christian possessed such a revelation
as groundwork for his faith.&nbsp; I hold the supposed revelation
in my hand.&nbsp; What does it reveal?&nbsp; That God made man
and woman in the same day, but that he made them separately, the
man long before the woman.&nbsp; That God gave them the fruit of
every tree for food, but prohibited them from eating the fruit of
one tree, and never intended <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>that of another to be eaten by them;
that he placed the man and woman in a garden within reach of the
tree whose fruit they were forbidden to eat on pain of death, but
the fruit of which was made good for food and pleasant to the
eyes; that God made a serpent more subtle than all the beasts of
the field; that this serpent tempted Eve, and she ate the
forbidden fruit, and gave to the man who ate also, and thus both
fell; that God, who had foreseen and predestined all this
terrible farce, cursed for Adam&rsquo;s sake all human kind,
millions being thus involved in Adam&rsquo;s ruin.&nbsp; That all
this was the work of an all-wise and all-good God, with whom is
no variableness nor shadow of turning.&nbsp; This God, who is not
a man that he can repent, afterwards repented that he had made
man, and, although not subject to passions, it grieved him at his
heart, and he resolved to destroy all mankind.&nbsp; That,
man&rsquo;s thoughts being wicked, this God of love and
forgiveness, of long suffering and loving kindness, destroyed not
only the full-grown man and woman, but also the little child as
yet without thought.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s thoughts being wicked, God
drowned the whole world, including bird, beast, and creeping
thing.&nbsp; Did you ever picture to yourselves this story of the
flood?&nbsp; Just paint in imagination a mother with her child in
her arms, wearily toiling up some hill, slippery with the falling
waters.&nbsp; See her fleeing from the waves coming swift behind,
like ravenous wolves, with gaping mouths greedy for her
life.&nbsp; Imagine her cry to heaven for mercy, not for herself
alone, not so much for herself, but for her child, a child, which
sucking at her breast, as yet knows no sin.&nbsp; Then picture
your all-loving and merciful God shutting his ears to her wild
shrieks for mercy, and drowning her and her babe in the
flood.</p>
<p>Did you ever picture to yourselves the scene when, the world
being again peopled, its inhabitants intended to build a tower
that would reach to heaven, and God, the all-wise, hearing of it
in heaven, where he then resided, came down to earth to see
whether the rumour was true, and finding that it was, confounded
the language of men?&nbsp; Do you recollect how God chose
Abraham&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t deny that he was worth choosing,
a man who was just 75 years old when he had lived 135
years&mdash;how God, the infinite and omnipresent, came down from
heaven and told Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the
earth should be blessed; and that Abraham, though so old that his
body was &ldquo;as good as dead,&rdquo; should have a son in his
old age?&nbsp; Have you read how God, who cannot lie, <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>with a
covenant and an oath promised a certain land to Abraham, and how
he never gave him &ldquo;so much as to set his foot
on?&rdquo;&nbsp; Have you read how Sarah, it having ceased to be
with her after the manner of women, laughed when God made the
promise of a son; how God asked why she laughed; and how Sarah,
whose faith is praised, denied to God&rsquo;s very face that she
had laughed at all?&nbsp; Have you read that God said, I am the
God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; that Jacob proved to be a
knave and a liar; that Jacob made a conditional bargain with the
Almighty God, that if the Lord would do certain things for him,
then the Lord should be his God?&nbsp; Have you read how God
promised to protect Abraham&rsquo;s children, and how they became
slaves in Egypt, and how he left them to be oppressed?&nbsp; Have
you read how, hearing their cries, God took them out of Egypt,
amongst a number of nations who had committed no crime against
the Jews, but were created by God to be destroyed by his chosen
people?&nbsp; Have you traced the track of blood and murder from
Egypt to Palestine?&nbsp; Have you read how God gave the
Israelites the right to make war on any city, and if the
inhabitants made peace, then they were tributaries, but if not
&ldquo;I, the Lord God, will deliver them into thy hands; thou
shalt smite them utterly, and leave alive nothing that
breatheth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say that this is not a revelation of love; it is the
revelation, the outgrowth of the instincts, of a barbarous and
brutal people.&nbsp; My Lord Bishop, not content with relying on
this revelation, after telling us that the existence of a Deity
cannot be demonstrated, seeks to supply us with a demonstration
by a vague reference to the argument from design.&nbsp; He says
that there are in the universe evidences of a designer.&nbsp;
This argument from design is a most dangerous one, for the
existence of stings and fangs may be evidences of a designing
malevolence; but permit me to dismiss the argument with a
quotation from Sir William Hamilton.&nbsp; He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are utterly unable to conceive that it
is possible for the complement of existence to have been either
increased or diminished.&nbsp; We cannot, on the one hand,
conceive of nothing becoming something, or on the other hand, of
something becoming nothing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I challenge the Lord Bishop to show that it is possible to
imagine any time when the whole of the universe did not
exist.&nbsp; Creation! who is it that really believes in
creation?&nbsp; Do any of you?&nbsp; Let us fathom the depths of
the past as far back as we will, there is still the great
impenetrable beyond.&nbsp; No man, even <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>in thought,
can annihilate existence, or bring to light a first evolution of
nature, and say, Here the universe began.&nbsp; There can be no
origination of the universe conceivable by the human mind.&nbsp;
But suppose you could in thought annihilate the universe.&nbsp;
You say that God is unchangeable.&nbsp; Was there a moment when
he began to create?&nbsp; Then is not that an assumption of an
act of change?&nbsp; I will not stop to argue on this
point.&nbsp; The bishop did not on this head condescend to argue
at all.&nbsp; His third sermon was only a torrent of ably
delivered words, and however fitting it might be for those whose
faith was firm, it was useless for drawing to the Church those
without faith.&nbsp; The Bishop says, Our faith in Christ is
confirmed by the story of his life as recorded by his
disciples.&nbsp; He says that whether the Gospel of John is true
or untrue, it contains the delineation of a perfect being.&nbsp;
He spoke of Christ as being better than any man the world has yet
seen, as the only teacher whose life was better than his
teaching.&nbsp; What is the history of his life?&nbsp; Jesus was
born without a father.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s husband had two
fathers.&nbsp; Jesus was descended from David, through Joseph,
who was not his father.&nbsp; He was born in the reign of Herod,
but was not born till after the death of Herod.&nbsp; Jesus
passed his early life in Egypt, but he was during the same time
in Jud&aelig;a.&nbsp; He was baptised by John, who knew him
before the baptism, but who did not know him till he had been
baptised.&nbsp; Jesus was taken into the wilderness, where he
fasted forty days, but he was during part of the same time at a
marriage feast in Cana of Galilee.&nbsp; During the forty
days&rsquo; fasting, the devil took Jesus to the top of a high
mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and said,
All these will I give thee, it thou wilt fall down and worship
me.&nbsp; Yet this Jesus was, as the Bishop teaches, very God of
very God; and if so, could not be tempted with an offer of his
own creation by his own creature; and the temptation must have
been a sham.&nbsp; Jesus is said to have worked miracles, but the
people who had the opportunity of seeing them never believed in
them or him.&nbsp; He fed 5,000 persons with five loaves and a
few fishes, and yet his own disciples&mdash;who, he promised,
should sit on twelve thrones, judging the tribes of
Israel&mdash;when many persons had to be fed at another time,
wondered how it was to be done.&nbsp; Jesus was betrayed by Judas
with a kiss; but he was not so betrayed, for when the armed men
came to Jesus he asked them, Whom seek ye? and they answered, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Jesus of
Nazareth; he said, I am he.&nbsp; Jesus was crucified early in
the morning, and yet at noon he was still on his trial.&nbsp;
Jesus was three days and three nights in the grave; but he was
crucified on Friday, his body was taken down from the cross on
Friday evening, and it must have been late on Friday evening when
he was put into the sepulchre; the first people who looked into
it on Saturday night, as it began to dawn towards Sunday morning,
found that the body was gone; so that from Friday night till
Sunday morning, made three days and three nights!&nbsp; Jesus
appeared to two of his disciples, and they did not know him; he
walked with them till the evening, and then they knew him.&nbsp;
When it was daylight they did not know him, but when it was dark
then they knew him.&nbsp; While they could see him, they did not
know him; when they knew him, they could not see him.&nbsp; Such
is the story of Jesus.&nbsp; It is not true that his life was
better than that of any other man.</p>
<p>I will take a noble life, and put it against the life of
Jesus, the life of the Infidel Bruno against the life of your God
Jesus.&nbsp; Bruno was born near Naples, and trained as a
monk.&nbsp; Leaving his ministry, to teach people in their vulgar
tongue, he was driven out of Italy.&nbsp; Going to Switzerland,
bigotry was too strong, and he was driven thence.&nbsp; At Paris
he debated with the doctors of the Sorbonne, until arguments
failing them, they drove him away with threats of the
faggot.&nbsp; From Paris he went to England, there debating at
Oxford and Cambridge; thence to Germany; and thence back to
Italy, where a prison awaited him, as a full refutation of his
heresies, where he was confined in a dungeon for eleven years,
where the rack was the answer to his arguments, and where he at
last died, a gallant martyr at the stake.&nbsp; He died
fearlessly confronting his enemies, having truly told them that
they had more fear in condemning him to be burned alive, than he
had in being condemned.</p>
<p>Jesus was God, and could not die; but if your Bible be true,
his last words were a despairing cry, &ldquo;My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compare these two men in their lives and their deaths, and see
which was the nobler and the braver.&nbsp; Jesus did not come to
save the world.&nbsp; He said, I am sent only to the lost sheep
of Israel.&nbsp; Jesus told his disciples not to go to the
Gentiles, be forbade them even to visit the Samaritans, and it
was not till after his resurrection that he said, Go ye into all
the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.&nbsp; I have
spoken in language which you may think unfitting <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>for such a
theme.&nbsp; Do you believe the Bishop, that Jesus died to save
all mankind?&nbsp; Do you believe the doctrine, that only those
who have faith in Jesus can be saved?&nbsp; What is to become of
those who have never heard his name?&nbsp; Do you believe that
all the Chinese will be damned?&nbsp; If you believe this, what
must you think of God?&nbsp; If you believe that the Chinese will
be pardoned, because they cannot be expected to believe in Jesus
of whom they have not heard, how can you be so wicked as to send
them Bibles and missionaries, which may bring them to
damnation?&nbsp; I plead here for what some call infidelity, for
what some call heresy.&nbsp; I plead for the rights of
humanity.&nbsp; I plead against a system which, to my mind, has
greatly hindered the education of the world, and impeded its
improvement; and if you tell me that my language is coarse and
blasphemous, I will ask you in what language do your missionaries
describe the Mohammedan and his Koran, the Brahmin and his
Vedas?&nbsp; You call me an Infidel; what are you?&nbsp; You
disbelieve all the religions of the world save one, I disbelieve
that one also; my disbelief is but one degree greater than
yours.</p>
<p>A Bishop comes now in the nave of the Cathedral, to answer
modern Infidelity.&nbsp; Why does modern Infidelity exist?&nbsp;
Why has Infidelity grown?&nbsp; It has grown because the Church
has grown fat and the people lean.&nbsp; It has grown because
Convocation quibbles over rites and formularies, instead of
devising schemes for the redemption of mankind from ignorance;
because the Church said nothing while back streets were built for
the poor, and grand abbeys and cathedrals for the priest.&nbsp;
The rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer, while the Church
pretends to regard as a blessing the poverty she carefully
avoids.&nbsp; The Church pretends to have the authority to speak
in the name of God, and the Bishop, on that last evening, prayed
for my conversion.&nbsp; You see the effect of that prayer in
these lectures.&nbsp; Clergymen threw down the gauntlet, and it
has been taken up.&nbsp; We have been attacked, and we will
compel the Church to afford us a hearing.&nbsp; You have now no
right to say that we are too insignificant, after you have
yourselves challenged us to the fray.&nbsp; You must not pretend
that modern Infidelity is too blasphemous; you have undertaken to
confute it by competent persons.&nbsp; I appeal to Christians of
every sect for one thing only; I don&rsquo;t ask you to give me
your faith, but to remember that amid the hundreds of religions
with innumerable antagonistic Churches and Chapels, <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>that amid the
multiplicity of error, you may be wrong.&nbsp; We do not pretend
to be perfect thinkers, nor thinkers free from error; we claim
only to be earnest thinkers, desiring to be set right where
wrong.&nbsp; I deny the right of any Church to pretend to be the
only true Church.&nbsp; I take the right to utter my
thoughts.&nbsp; The Church of England is a rotten Church, a
falling Church, a Church divided against itself, a Church with
Colensos and Voyseys, as against Puseys and Mackonochies, a
Church which by the admission of her own divines is illogical,
which cannot defend her Thirty-nine Articles, nor her Athanasian
Creed.</p>
<p>I have finished these lectures, and I ask those who intend to
follow me to remember that Freethought has done something since
the days of Spinoza, Carapanella, and Bruno.&nbsp; It is only
since Freethinkers began to fight against the Church that there
has been any real popular progress made by you Liberals.&nbsp;
The Church has not helped you at all.&nbsp; It has by its bench
of bishops hindered your reforms as long as it could, and
maintained tithes and exactions and bad laws till humanity
rebelled against the obstruction.&nbsp; Whether right or wrong,
we have at least done something to make the world better worth
living in.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
